It may take less time   but I don't know about easier  Yuck , Hey   young lady   get back here and have some breakfast
Dad   I never eat breakfast , Breakfast is brain food  Maybe that's why your grades are Suffering
Alright  You win  Please pass the brain food , What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ?
They need to eat healthy foods   but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day  They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether   though , So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate   don't you ?
Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda  Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever , And have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
You might not believe this   but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! , Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from  I've got strawberry   peach   chocolate   coffee   vanilla and praline

Well   I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room   and maybe some new drapes for the windows  Also   a grandfather clock would look great in the den  Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room , Wow   you really do have a talent for this   Alice  Thanks for the suggestions

With the cut I'll give you   we will minimize a lot of that , Thank you !
I am looking for cologne   small bottle  Can I see that one in the glass shelf ? , Yes   of course   this one costs 260 yuan
What's the difference between the two ? , It's difficult to explain  But this one is really cheap
It costs only 25 yuan , Oh   it's too expensive  Can't you make it any cheaper ?
How much would you like it to be   then ? , What about 15 yuan ?
I think you've got a real bargain , Thank you

We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain  Do you like them ? , Yes   I love them   but they are fragile  It is not convenient to take them
Of course  These paintings have many designs   such as animals   flowers   landscape   aquatics and so on , They are beautiful   but I can't understand the connotation in them  Let me see the handkerchiefs
This is a series of animals   called Chinese zodiac , Good  So I will take three series and five bamboo ones
Would you please show me that mural ? , Certainly  Here you are
That's a bit more than I wanted to pay  Can you cut the price down a bit ? , I'm sorry  Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this
Thank you  Here is four hundred yuan , Thank you  Please come again
Anything else ? , Um   I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day

At the gym ? , No  I like to be outside  I took up hiking and mountain biking

Sure  Most facials start with a thorough cleaning  Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin   followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull  After that   we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension   followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin , That's exactly what I want  How long does it take ?
Well   the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan  If you want make-up   another 20 yuan will do , Good   I will take the one hour facial with make-up

Well   the weather might have some influence   during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot , Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?

Look   this is a pimple ! , Oh   I think it is
I have no bad habit  I sleep eight hours a day   never eat spicy food   clean the face twice a day and so on  I have done a lot , I know you have done a lot   but you always sleep very late  Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy  Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body   and I think this is your problem

Tommy played truant today  His teacher called me this morning , Where did he go ?
Stop   stop  We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study  Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school , Pay him ? But he studies for himself   not for you or for me or for anybody else  I got an idea  You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins   you can go to work
That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school  So now I am much more clever than you , What is this big box at the front door ?
I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months , So   what's in the box ? A fridge ?

What type of diet were you on ? , I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating  With a combination of eating better and exercising   I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months

I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of , Ah  but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet

I overcooked the corn , That's okay  I like it better that way anyway

Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! , Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet

What's his problem ? , This may be complicated  But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem
Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films  So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive , What you said is true  But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience  For example   to make more movie Ccds   so people will spend money buying them
There are many new kinds of newspapers  I find it hard to choose among them  Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? , I'd recommend you the Morning Paper   it is true that the paper is a newly issued one   but its circulation is rising  Last month   it reached to three hundred thousand   which is a very good figure for a new paper

That's great  That means I can bring my cat   Mr  Twinkles  Where is the apartment located ? , It says it's located in the suburbs
Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? , Yes   my friend Steve  I'll introduce you
I know   that's my problem  What do you think I should do ? , Well   maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate
Wow   that would be very convenient  How much is the rent ? , It says it's $ 1600  But if you share it with another person   that's only $ 800 per month
I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised , Yes   we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery  And they are all newly renovated
I'm sure it is wonderful   but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost , Ah !

We need to find a good realtor , Not necessary  If we use a realtor to find a house   it will be more expensive
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles , Yes   that's often true  But you have to pay them
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? , It takes a little more time  We have to check the ads in the paper  Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads  Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them
Why ? , That is because if the seller has a realtor   their price will be higher  He will have to pay a commission to the realtor
I want to look in the papers today  Maybe we can see something we like , All right  I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore

I agree  The colors must be soft and pleasant  You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners , Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking   dear  You will cook
And you'll have to sell your motorcycle  And your cameras  Right ? , Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week  How is that ?

I'm like that too  I like to invite friends over sometimes   but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment , What is your favorite coffee ?
Not very often  Making coffee is a bit troublesome  Most of the time   I just buy takeout at Starbucks  And also   I quite like instant coffee , I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular  Though its taste is not perfect   it's really cheap and convenient
Yes  No doubt about that  For us   coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink  I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee , No   we don't   especially the elder people  But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays
Yes   you're at the right stop , Thank you

My purposes are two-fold  On the one hand   I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work  On the other hand   bicycling is a sport   and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends , Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ?
Are they designed differently ? , A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame  Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars  It's not particularly beefy in construction   and generally   it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces  In contrast   mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame  You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over

I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost  All you need is a racket   a table and a light celluloid ball  Tables are usually available in public recreation areas   like finest rooms   and outdoor playgrounds , And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks
Yeah   the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom   Dick and Jane in this developing country  No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it , I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong

Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics  Do you know Jin Yong ? , I know he is a martial arts fiction writer  But I've read none of his novels
Yes   take philosophy   for instance  What makes a true   respectable da via   or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable  It also involves a man's character   sense of justice   and values of life , So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation   isn't it ?

Yes  Playing chess is a very aggressive experience  All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents  Whenever I start a chess game   I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill , But isn't it the same with wiki ?

For my part   xiangqi  Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese , I think chess is more reasonable  You see   each side has eight pawns   a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi  A true battle should be like that  Soldiers should outnumber the commanders
Yeah   and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards   he has a queen who is the most powerful piece  I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China , There's another distinctive contrast  Both board games use a total of 32 pieces   but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board   bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess

Okay  The library's beside the baker's  I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week  They're overdue , I'll see you later then
Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West , No   absolutely not ! On the contrary   you'll be considered a well-connected   sociable man   if you keep involved in the conversation all the time  But always pay attention to what you say  If the table has a senior guest   say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible  Or maybe   you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested
Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? , Yes   plenty of them  Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others  And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely
I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday , Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ?
If I remember right   she likes music   skiing   and reading , You know   maybe we could get her some concert tickets  Who would know her favorite groups ?
Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now , Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift
Yes  Behind a lifestyle   there is a culture  Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life  While they may not really like coffee   they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places , Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea   rather than coffee   has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people
Well   that's true  In a sense   it is not so much what you drink that really counts   as where and how you drink , Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot  Did you not sleep well ?
I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me  But if I keep gulping down one cup after another   I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick , You lose face by refusing to drink   and the host might think you refuse to give him face  The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up  This will endear you to your friends
I got you  Next time  I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway , Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes   their parents would offer me a cup of hot   strong tea   though they never inquired of me about whether I want it
It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop  But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face  When the host pours hot water into his cup   he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table   meaning " Thanks "  No matter if he likes it or not   it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup , So next time   I'd better take a few sips   to ' save face ' at least   right ?
More often than not   the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' , I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday
Twenty dollars per dozen , That sounds like a good deal
Is there anything else you'd like to get ? , No   the roses will be fine
Yes  I would like to place a collect call , Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?
What reasons do westerners drink for ? , I don't think drinking requires any special purposes  For us people in the West   the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine
Yeah  It's of supreme importance that the goblet   table-cloth   and plates should be made shiningly clean   so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable , Yes  For me   who can't hold much liquor   it's particularly agreeable  If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet !
Those people are quarrelling , It's raining heavily
Let's go under the tree , No   we can't  It's thundering
It's Cindy   you know that  Hey   Cindy   say hello to Maria , Cindy   you're so cute
Oh   a cat ? Come on , Yes   cats are always gentle  and they don't need a lot of space since they're small
Well   cats are certainly more independent , Absolutely  Believe it or not   I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago
Poor cat , Now we get along very well  It makes me feel that I'm someone special
People drive on the right in China , Oh   that's interesting !
OK , Look   traffic jam again !
I hate the car columns on the road , But we couldn't help it
So you have all the news on broadcast ? , Yes   it's so helpful
No   there's no parking sign , Oh   the policeman's coming
The old man is knocked down by the bicycle , John   it ’ s time to get up
What ’ s the time ? , It ’ s nearly half past seven
Are you sure half past seven ? , Positive  I ’ ll put the radio on
I could have stayed in bed for another half hour , This is the rush hour
I'm afraid I'll be late , How often does the bus run ?
It comes on the dot , Why do you stop me ?
Do you know this is a Onaway street ? , I don't know
I think something must be done , Yeah   we should have more roads built
Things change every minute , We have too many cars !
I seeThe bus doesn't come so often as in cities , You're right
Why ? anything special there ? , It's more than special  You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more
That's terrific  I can't wait to check it out , Hang on  are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
Pardon ? , I mean   most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria   they are likely to cause immune system problems
Oh   I should have thought of my brother's baby girl  Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet , Yes   good luck   Maria
How long will it take me to get there ? , Only about twenty minutes
May I take a bus to get there ? , You can take the No  22 trolley bus to get there
I'm sick of it   too , The door bell doesn't work   the sink is leaking
Do you like shopping ? , Yeah  I go shopping once a week
I mean you can buy things through the Internet   that is E-commerce , Really ? That's unbelievable
How long have you waited ? , Twenty minutes exactly
I'd better take a taxi , That's no useThis is morning rush hour
I'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus , We have to wait six more minutes !
Have you ever seen such a nice house ? , Not really
I've found a nice place in this districtThree bedrooms   a large kitchen , high ceilings   a tile bath and a big drawing room
It's a two-bedroom one   and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen , It's a bit small but looks nice
YesWe ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent , Oh   how niceThey ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet
That sounds just wonderful to us , When do you want to move in ?
My dear   it's five flights up ! , That's all rightWe ' ll get used to itBesides   it is quiet up there
Is the place well-furnished ? , Yes   it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play
And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires , Are the plumbing all right ?
And the sinks don't seem to leak , The place is OK  Let's go there and have a look at it again
That's nice  Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? , Yeah   I know that  But at those places  the prices they ask you are ridiculously high   and if you don't bargain hard   you will get ripped-off
Yeah   I have the same feeling  Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality  Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed  But at a wholesale market   you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not , That's why I like department stores more  Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to
You're so careless   Billy , Sorry   Mum   I'll lock it right away
An mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones  mp4 ? , Oh   that's a good idea  Perhaps I should have a try
That's Ok  you know   digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry   and they won't cost you too much , Yeah   if I buy a cell phone like this   I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go   and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4
Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB , Can I help you ?
No   thanks , George   did you remember to buy me the book ?
I promise you'll have it tomorrow , Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue
Indeed   it's unfair  Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans  Lower-income households   on the other hand   can only get smaller loans   or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing , Like you and me !
Here's the moneyAnd get some salt , Yes   Mum
I've never heard Mary cursed anybody  But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today , Oh  Why did she do that ?
No   I'm not clear , we've spent $ 1 000
I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades , What do you think is the biggest change ?
Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? , I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned  I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room
Two of my sisters still live at home   even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs  They enjoy spending their free time with my parents  I guess in that respect   I'm the black sheep of the family , I see  Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?
Well   I am a little bit out of shape  I think I should get some exercise to keep fit  what kind of service do you offer ? , First of all   we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs
What else ? , Since everyone is different   your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level  Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal
Perhaps one month  I'll just have a try at first , Wise decision  that is 400 yuan  You'll find it's totally worth it
Yeah   you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly  The training really pays off  Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit , Really ? tell me about it  I haven't gone to the club for a long time  I am too busy with work
The trainer tells me   besides regular sports activities   I should also have a healthy and balanced diet , Sounds reasonable
Surely it is  Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness , I've heard that  Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
You bet it ! , Hey   Jimmy   you've been sitting in front of the TV all day  Anything interesting on TV ?
I know   I knowBut my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes  It's the series finals   and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! , Really ? What's the series about ?
I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting  Take this show for example   it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream   with hilarious results , Really ? that's interesting !
Have you ever tried shopping online ? , No   never  I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it   especially for clothes and shoes
That happens  Without close quality examination   we may encounter fraud   and the e-shop may suddenly disappear , What's more   it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password
Me too  Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information   and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping , That's a good idea
Yeah   he got booted after his initial performance in the audition   but he did not give up  He then tried at another two auditions , He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest  Fortunately   in the third audition   he has won popularity among the audience  And that's when I started to notice him
Yeah   there're so many excellent candidates out there  Who knows which one will make it to the final ? , Absolutely  That's why when he entered the finale   I was so excited
Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? , Yes   I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl '  The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US   which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences
But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days  There's no such program on this year , Yeah   these programs are gradually losing their appeal
The same is true for ' My Hero '  Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' , I think producers are underestimating the audience  They should think of better ways to entertain the general public
Really ? Do you often shop online ? , Yes  I buy most of my daily necessities online
Wounds good   and I don't have to queue up at the cashier , And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall
Are there many choices of online shopping ? , Sure  You can buy almost anything you can think of
There is so much information and I advise to read newspaper , Will that work ?
Do you like the room ? , Yes  What is the rent ?
At the beginning of the month  Besides   you should pay me $ 1000 as deposit , Do you have any apartment to rent ?
In the downtown   near the square , Is it furnished ?
What about next saturday , Fine
Which bus should I take to railway station ? , You can take a No  2 bus here
Julia   what time is it ? , Eight o'clock  It's time for you to get up and have breakfast
Oh   I have a poor memory now  I haven't had enough sleep lately  I had a bad dream just now , You have been too tired recently   darling  That's why I didn't wake you up this morning  After breakfast   you can go to sleep again
Okay  I'm going to stay up a while  I've got to go over the household budget  We've sightly overspent this month , Oh   can't you do it tomorrow ? It's already past 10
Okay  Good night  Have a good dream , Good night
Could I have a look at it first ? , Sure  Let me show you the way  Here we are  Apartment 1008  ( They enter  ) This is the living room dining room combination  Here's the kitchen  It's small   but fully equipped  The refrigerator is new   and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old
Is there air conditioning ? , Yes   there's central air conditioning and heating  The thermostat is in the living room 。
I like the apartment   MrSellers  You can show me the lease , What's the name of this street ?
You'll see one at the corner on your right , Can you hold the end of this tape measure ?
What about measuring the floor for a new carpet   and the walls for new wallpaper ? , I thought we'll just fix up the wood floorand use some paint for the walls
Julia   the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters , Great  Where is it ?
Very quiet and safe  And it's got a lot of trees and plants , That's good  Is the location easily accessible ?
Have you ever thought about your ideal home ? , I have   actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself
How many rooms would it have ? , I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each   and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite  I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other
How would you decorate your house ? , I don ’ t like a lot of clutter   so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out  I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls   but other than that   most things would be kept in closets
We need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on , Why ?
Let's see  We spent $ 700 for our home loan payment   $ 300 0n groceries   $ 75 0n utilities   $ 250 n gasoline   $ 100 on books   and $ 400 0n entertainment last month , That's $ 1 825
Right  Stop thinking about it  Where do you think we can save more money ? , Well   we could eat in more often  That $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants
Excuse me   can you tell me where central Park Street is ? , Turn right at the third light and then go straight for two blocks
I see  Thanks a lot , You're welcome
Thank you , Excuse me   how do I get to the Forbidden City ?
No   it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot , Thank you
Will it take me long to get there ? , No  It's not far at all
It ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! , We ’ re glad that you ’ re here  Would you like a tour of the house ?
That would be lovely   thanks , Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
Well   I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table   but I don ’ t really care for curtains  Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient , My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift
I see  Well   I can help with the chores while I ’ m here  You two could probably use my help , That ’ s very nice of you to offer  Here ’ s your tea  Be careful   it ’ s still quite hot
Do you mean that I go that way for one block   then turn right ? , Yes   you are right
Thank you very much , It's my pleasure
They are very nice   you know , Really ?
Everybody's buying them , Are they ?
Excuse me   Is there a hotel nearby ? , The nearest one is about ten minutes ' walk from here
Can you tell me the way to library ? , Sure   turn left at the next crossing
Alright   tell me what you think , Don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ?
No   I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon   but I love the way it looks  I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual   yet sophisticated , I like the jeans   but you need something to go with the top  It ’ s too plain on its own
That ’ s a good idea  You have a lot of good fashion sense , Thanks  You ’ d be ok on your own  There are loads of fashion victims out there   and you are not one of them  Have you tried it on yet ?
The leopard print sounds fabulous  Are they a name brand ? , No   they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing
It ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! , This suit looks niceCan I try it on ?
No   thanks  I'm just looking , Hello   may I speak to Kevin   please ?
I ’ m sorry she is not in at the moment  Can I take a message ? , It ’ s ok  I ’ ll call her back latter  Thank you
It's 89 yuan , Do you have it in a larger size ?
Would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking , This is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax
Sure  We should probably pre-heat the oven right away   too , That's a good idea  Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ?
You know   I could do this myself  Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? , I don't think it's broken
Excuse me   do you go to the Central Park ? , Yes   this is the right bus
( A few minutes later  ) Should I get off at the next stop ? , No   don't worry  I'll get you off when you get there
OK  I know  Thank you , Not at all
Yes   I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place , We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice
I wish it wasn't   but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here , Really ? I never would have guessed  The criminals must only come out in the evenings   because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime
When I first moved in   I walked everywhere  But within a week   I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now   I always take public transportation , Has anything else happened to you ?
Excuse me   I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutesDo you know why the traffic is so heavy ? , A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it   so all the traffic was held up
I agree with you  But now we have to wait  The sky is overcast   and it is very sultry  I fear a thunder storm is brewing , Don ’ t worry  The traffic jam is said to be over soon
Julia   Julia   Julia  My daring Julia   what's wrong with you ? , Steven   are you talking to me ?
Did someone get hurt ? , A driver died instantly  The other one was badly hurt  A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too
Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? , I don ’ t understand  Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool
Please take me to the Honging Hotel , OK  Please get in  I'm glad to serve you
I am in a hurry  Please take a shortcut  I have a friend waiting for me , OK   I promise we'll get there in twenty minutes
You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world , I know  But we could get some exercise in   and we could get some errands run   too  Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything
I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight , Fine   we'll do that on the way home   so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time
Ok   let's go then ! , Do you have any money ?
You said you were only going to window shop ! , I agreed to not go into the mall   but I can still look at things in the market !
I'm not sure   but I think It's open until 4 o'clock , What time is it now ?
I love this store  The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive , Don ’ t worry  I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress
Sure  That ’ s really nice of you  Let ’ s go in and try some things on , How about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you
I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me  Do they have the same dress in white ? , Let me look  Let ’ s see  they ’ Ve got one in blue   green   pink   black  and white  Here you are
I ’ m so lucky  You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey ! , Steven   you are always looking in good shape  How do you keep it ?
I eat more fruits and vegetables and limit amounts of fatty and fried foods , And ?
You are what you eat   and a healthy diet creates a body resistant to disease , Thanks for sharing your experience with me
Not very well  I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet , How much are you looking to spend ?
Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room , Well   if you want to live in London   you have to pay the price !
I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates   but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! , How long do you want to sign a contract for ?
I don ’ t have any furniture   so it ’ d be great if it were furnished , You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent   right ?
I don't think I can afford that , Don ’ t worry  Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children
Why do you say that ? , I heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago  The robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight
Is the security door useful ? , Yes   I think so  The security door is so firm that nobody can break in
MrSellers ? It's Steven speaking   your tenant  We've just suffered a power failureWhat should I do now ? , All right   Steven  Do you have a flashlight ?
How do I know if it's blown out ? , You'll see it's black and has burnt smell
OK   I'll try  I'll call you again if that doesn't work , How do I get to the post office from school ?
You are welcome  Hope you can find it soon , What's your apartment like ?
It's not as bad as I thought it would be  The freshmen that live nearby are really loud   especially on the weekends  But   the rent is much cheaper than private housing   so it's worth it , Did you have to pay a deposit ?
No   it's all included  Besides   students don't have to pay council tax   so we're saving quite bit of money by living here , How long is your contract for ?
Not yet  I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer , Good luck !
So   what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ? , It's great ! Unfortunately   we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up
Sounds fascinating  Where is your new house located ? , It's just off of the ring road
Is your house well-lit ? , Oh   yes  Our windows let plenty of natural light in  They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house
I'd be up for that ! , Steven   what's the expense of moving house ?
I am afraid not   darling  Our expenses are mounting , We have to cut back on our shopping from now on
Oh   the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people , Beauty costs   dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?
When you buy clothes   you must think about the material   quality and price , Maybe you have a point
That's true   but you already have two back coats and one black sweater , Oh ! Hey   look   that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert
It's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it  Oh   no   I'm a little short  Did you bring your credit card ? , Yes

That depends  What is it ? , It's kind of a big favor  I'm absolutely flat broke   and I owe my landlady $ 200  she's given me until Friday to give it to her   but I don't get paid until next Monday  Do you think you could loan me some cash until I get paid ?
Let's see   I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend  I can only spare about $ 20  I would give you more if I had it   I just don't have much money to my name right now , Thanks a lot Ayden  Every little bit will help  Tell you what   if you aren't doing anything tonight   why don't you come over and have dinner at my place
See you then ! , Yes   sir  Where would you like to go ?

That ’ s a really long line  How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? , It takes about 3 minutes per person   so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait

Well   Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods , I suppose so
This one ? , No   the other one  yes
This cover comes with the racket , How much does it come up to ?

That's true , Anyway   how was your such   Catherine ?
Well   I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy , I guess you're right  More often than not   people go there only for convenience  The foods may taste good   but generally speaking   they are high in calories   salt and fat
Well   actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places , Seriously ?
Oh no  I broke your vase accidentally , How did it happen ?
I feel miserable  Can I give you money for it ? , Maybe I shouldn't have put it here  Someone was bound to bump it eventually

I haven't thought of that , You see   the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then   like diving   their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend  They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord

Ideal posture is to sit straight   but not stiff   against the back of the chair , Yes
Oh   four or five  How much is the rent for this apartment ? , 150 a month

Chinese people don't like to eat cold food , Is that right ?
With cold milk ! , A Westerner said to his Chinese friend  “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup  It ’ s disgusting  ” The Chinese friend replied   “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating  It ’ s even worse  ”
The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated  The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate  I assume it is less complicated   right ? , Not really  I did some research about Chinese table manners  The important rule is to remain silent while eating  Of course   this refers to family meals only  Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health  It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party  The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated  Each dish should be placed in the correct position  When fish is served   the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty  If it is in winter   the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter  Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table  The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths  No noise should be made when chewing  No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it  One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise  All these table manners are very similar to Western habits

It ’ s easy to say   but I will try , Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior  Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods   etc  Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire
I know Mark is your only child  You may do it differently from what I did  Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles , I do it   too  You know   sometimes when we eat   my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat  And if it were something he doesn ’ t like   he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes  He does it very often  I really get mad  I can ’ t help spank him sometimes
But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him  It ’ s not easy   I know  It ’ s hard , Yeah  I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper  My child is almost two years old   and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something

See that  It's so dangerous  My mom would never allow me to do that , Hey   don't be so pathetic  It's a maximal sports show  What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show
Anyway   the show is breathtaking  By the way   where did they get so much snow in here ? , Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? , It's possible  But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can
Can I help you   sir ? , Yes   please  I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife
OK  How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway   it won't cost you much  It's only around $ 5995 for each pair  It might be cheaper than that in America , Hey   How did you know I came from America ?
$ 5995 , That's really cheap for shoes like those  OK   I'll take 5 pairs
Because in this duty-free shop   your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife , Oh   my God  I've totally forgotten about that  Anyway   I think she would like a bottle of perfume
It's $ 60 here , That's very unbelievable  Is it fake ?
I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places   while sitting in the morning sunshine , I can't agree more   honey  We need to get away from work from time to time
Sure  The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings , Well   let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn
Nothing special  Food   drinks   and Daniel's kangaroo toys , Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ?
Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science   OK ? It's a picnic ! , I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world
What can I do for you   young man ? , I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning
Here you are  And here are three crash helmets , Thanks  Well   those two kids are beginners  What should I do about their safety ?
That's a good idea  And remind them to be slow at the beginning   not to run into the railings , OK  Anything else ?
I just got a call from Mrs  Fitzgerald  See what your Willie has just done , My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ?
That was last time  This time it's worse , Ok   tell me
True   but that's not all  The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window , Ok   that's probably expensive   but not that bad
Stop interrupting me  Finally   the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal   who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs  Fitzgerald , Hmm   that is bad
Thank you , You ’ re welcome  The rain is quite heavy   isn ’ t it ?
Oh   that ’ s very kind of you  I am going to the Garden Hotel , I am going there   too  We can walk together
Lily   I ’ m not sure  Let me check   I think I spent $ 50 , Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money
That ’ s okay  I ’ m sorry   too  It ’ s a good idea to prepare for the future possibilities , So how's everything going for Christmas ?
No   I did that a long time ago  It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus , He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he   eight ?
Yes   he's too old to believe in that type of things  And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do , That happened to my oldest girl  She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real
Grandpa   this seat is for you   for you are the eldest person here and also it's your birthday today , Oh   you are such a good child today  Come here  Sit next to me
Great  That's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake , Now I see what you read the book for  But it's fine  I'll give you the lion's share
I see  Then I'll try it , Want to send out for some Chinese ?
No   I'd rather go out  The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home  Maybe we can try some other food today  What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day   the one over in the shopping center ? , Okay  I could go for that  It's called Al's Steakhouse  They also have great fried fish   and I love their salad bar  You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste , Don't worry  We'll just get a doggie bag
Oh   it's interesting  Dad told me you brought him here when he was young   too  Now   it's my turn , Yeah  We are the VIP customers here  So   what do you want to eat today ?
Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat  Grandpa   what's your favorite here ? , The Chinese rice pudding  Your father loves it   too  You wanna try ?
Great   I want it spicy , Come on  Don's go too far
Sorry   honey   something has cropped up again  I have to deal with it  Perhaps I will go to back home till very late , It's nothing  It's not the first time anyway
What ? Your golden watch is lost ? , Yeah  I just can't find it anywhere
Sis   why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded   and you can't find anything that you really want , You just don't get it  Looking for bargains can be really interesting
Come on  You know   you can never really win  The salesperson never loses  They make their living out of it , That's true  But I just love it  Come here !
Really ? Oh   this one  I like the cloisonn vase , Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week  It's surprising that there is something we both like  Well   what do you think of these ceramic cups ?
Don't underestimate his taste  I don't think he'd like it , Don't be so sure  He loves the vase I bought here last week
Hey   Terry   have all the players got here ? , Yeah   most of them have arrived  Don't worry  There are still 20 minutes left before the match
We are lucky to play in a new stadium , Hurry up   Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me  I'm good at shooting
Just calm down  It's just a turnover  Make up your mind and we can shoot well , Yes   I got it  Come on   Benjamin   don't let him get into the paint
But that game he dunked over me for 13 times , That's interesting  Let's hurry up   we should beat them in the first half
Tom   is Jenny crying ? , Can you take he away from me ?
She ’ s your sister  What she asked was only duck soup for you  Why can ’ t you be good to her ? , But I am her brother   not her servant
Trust me  I've been driving for two years , Ok  You drive and do be careful
Did you go to any illegal website ? , No   But does that matter ?
That's wise , Do you know what's wrong with my PC ?
Of course  You'd better learn something about it , I'm afraid yes  But what about the data I stored in the computer ?
What did the boss say ? , He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ?
Okay   then  What kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ? , It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English  So I need to be here only on Sunday
And a good way to get some pocket money , Let's do it together
Yes   but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive , Dad   hurry ! The train is coming  Aha   I am a superman
But   if we all pushed our way in   nobody could get off   and nobody could get in either , How many stops are there to the Aidan station ?
What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey   on pins and needles ! , Because I need to use the restroom  Is there a restroom on the train ?
Well   that is a question  You want to offer a suggestion ? , Oh   yeah   but not today  I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible
It's my pleasure   what can I do for you ? , I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today
Where are you staying ? , I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel
We sell them   right here , Great   do you have any for foreigners ? I mean English version ?
Oh   like a gentleman  Two tickets for two people , But I am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets
You may ask if you can take a half-price ticket , Yeah   I make certain  A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan
Oh   you see   we are on the 8th floor   and moving into the 6th floor in another building  It is about 15 kilometers to get there , OK   the cost depends on the floor to move to   the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move
Your charge is divided into two parts   the Payment in Advance and the rest  I thought that I should pay all of it before moving , No   firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs   and the rest when we finish moving
That was really a nightmare ! , Honey   what's up ?
I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue , Did you panic at the time ?
Of course   there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying , So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?
Yes  They should check the elevator regularly  I have to give them something to remember about   and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building , That was just an accident  you are worried too much about it  I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on
What ? , I said   I'm Ted   who are you ?
Huh ? I can't hear you   the music's too loud , Let's go outside and talk  So Laura   do you come here often ?
Sometimes   usually once every few weeks  Do you ? , No   this is my first time here
That's good  It's good to hit the books   but you need to get out once in a while , I guess so  But the music is too loud  I don't mind getting out and meeting people   but next time I'll do it in a park
Are you having any luck ? , Not really  There aren't any used bookcases listed  But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday  I think I'll go to them
I learned to negotiate from my mother  I thought I was pretty good at bargaining   but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store , What happened ?
I think it's great ! I really like the color   and it goes really well with your eyes  I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now   but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment , Um   ninety-five dollars ?
Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced   and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ? , I don't know   I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it  I guess I was too impulsive
They spend hours there   especially on weekends , Speaking of that trip   Alan bought a shirt at a department store   but the sleeves are too long  Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ?
No   it's easy  We'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip  They'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund , We ? Do you want to go with me ?
Hey Joe   what are you doing in this department store ? , Hi   Rita   I'm just looking for a pair of shoes  I won't be here for long
What do you mean ? This is a big store   isn't it ? , Yes   but I have unusually big feet  That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide   and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into
Well   you're in the right store  If they don't have it   no one will , After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me  I prefer white   so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size  Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications   it makes it a very easy choice
You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? , No   Officer   not at all
Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? , Um   because I was busy talking to my friend
That's definitely true  I'm going to have to give you a ticket  Please remember to drive more carefully next time , Let ’ s move out of here  This apartment is too small
Here ’ s an interesting ad , How much is the rent ?
It ’ s available now   and it ’ s got a very good location  You won ’ t be far from work , I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City
I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York , Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live
Which bank ? There are two   the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland , I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank

Oh   just one ! We have our own dog   and then we have a dog that we have that we are training , Do you ever see the dogs you trained   like out on the street   or anything ?
I guess the most important thing is companionship   right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what , Yeah   that's true  OK   besides cats   dogs   and fish   what are some other pets people keep ?
We ’ re on our own tonight   dad ’ s taking mom out , Out ? What do you mean out ?

You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself  You shouldn ’ t affect her decision , But I just want to give her some tips
Believe me  Everything will be ok , I hope so

She is quite young and her hair is blond , Is she strict ?

Oh   no   Nathan   I  I really think we've bought this flat at the right time   you know  Market prices are going to go up   and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more , But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating  I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished
Oh   why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy , Tom   you promised to cut the lung  You won't forget   will you ?
Ok , Do you promise ?
I'll see  I will if I can but I won't promise , But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight   won't you ?
Ok  I'll keep my promise , Hi  You said that you might need some help with preparing dinner  What would you like me to do ?
After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables   could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil  Fry the meat until it is cooked   then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it , Which spices are you going to add to the meat ?

Right  You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing  For example for delicates   you should set a shorter washing cycle  Also   be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing , So complicated ! Ok   what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?
No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton   you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes , You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned
It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? , I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater  I know it ’ s june now   but it will be perfect for autumn and winter

About ten days ago  I ’ Ve tried to use it since then  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t  it ’ s very frustrating , Is it still under warranty  If it is and I can ’ t fix it   it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one
What ’ s wrong with it ? , Part of the motor is loose  I can put it back in place quite easily
Yeah how ’ d you know ? , You can always spot the newbies  I can give you a few pointers if you want  Were you trying to use this machine here ?

Now far  About 150 meters perhaps , Ok  So I turn right at the traffic lights  Then ?
You ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial  It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building , God it  Thans very much
A crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? , Just joking  I would like to get a few bottles of beer though  We also need a liter of cooking oil
I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops , Ok  Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables  We need a bunch of bananas   a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes
I ’ d like a few cans of coke  We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages , let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too  Is that everything
The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states  Few other stories made the front pages , Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ?
Generally   the reporters take positive lines  They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of   but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports  In the classifieds   one of our competitors is advertising for people who speak Japanese , That ’ s interesting  They must be thinking of moving into that market  Are there any interesting editorials ?
Sure  There you are , Do you buy that newspaper every day ?
Yes  There is  it has several sections   so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning , What section does it have ?
World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail  I find it fascinating  Do you buy a daily paper ? , I buy a national newspaper sometimes   buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper  I find the local news more interesting than national or international news
Have you been drinking ? , No   I haven't sir
If you refuse to blow   you'll receive a much severer punishment , OK  I'll blow
I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months , Do you often buy magazines ?
Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for  Besides   I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes , Do you have an online edition of that magazine ?
Yes   I do  The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month  Do you every buy magazines ? , I only buy them if they look particularly interesting  I don ’ t buy any regularly
I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine , Which tests do you mean ?
Of course not   but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do  According to the jealousy test   I ’ m quite a jealous type of person  Perhaps I need to control my jealousy , Your dog is so much fun  He ’ s so playful  I wish our cat enjoyed being around people as much as your dog does
Yes  He ’ s so energetic  We take him out to the park every morning and evening  I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day ! , I ’ m sure he would  We usually have to drag him home
Have you ever thought about having another pet ? , The kids want a rabbit  I don ’ t think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish ! That might be too tempting for our cat !
I thought he usually wrote horror books , He does  He ’ s good at this genre too  It ’ s a captivating read
Me too  I need something to read on the flight to New York  I can never sleep on planes  Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter , I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography
What do you have ? , I have apple pie   ice cream   chocolate cake and fruit cocktail
I love you home made apple pie  It ’ s delicious  Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? , Sure  Can you get it yourself ? It ’ s in the refrigerator
Are you having any dessert ? , I ’ ll have apple pie too   but without ice cream  I have to watch my weight
I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before   but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street  It looks complicated , It ’ s about as complicated as chess  The basic rule and moves are simple enough   but there are many strategies that players need to learn
Do you play bridge ? , Yes   I do  It ’ s hard to find four players though   so I don ’ t play very often  Do you know anyone who plays ? If so   we could set up a game
I ’ ll call my friend now  you call yours , I ’ m thinking about getting a pet   but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable  Could you give me some advice ?
Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep  Is that a problem ? , Not really  By the way   I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous   like a tarantula or rattlesnake
Sure  Come over here  As you can see   I have a wide selection of species  They can live together   if you want lizards of different kinds  Do you have a favourite colour ? , I like the red one  What do they eat ?
That ’ s fine  You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet , I think I should join a fitness centre  I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape  Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath
Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ? , I smoke around 30 each day
Be careful when you go jogging  Don't put yourself under too much stress  You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition , I'll join a fitness centre  I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice  There's one near my office   so I can go before and after work  I don't want to go jogging in the street   so I'll use a treadmill
I'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill  Then I think I'll do some work with the dumbbless , Good idea  I'd suggest you do some crunches too  Thery're great for getting in shape  Make sure you do them correctly
Yes   it is  I'll be coming here regularly  I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape , The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina  Each time you use it   increase this distance  don't worry about your speed at first  You can increase that later
What do we need for the barbecue ? , Well   I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat  I ’ Ve got pork chops   small steaks   chicken wings   and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties
And if people drop them   they won ’ t break  We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers , They sell them at the shop around the corner  We can go and get some in a few minutes
How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ? , It only takes a few minutes  Some people like their meat well done  Others like it rare  The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked
Do you like cooking ? , I love it  I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it  It gives me a real sense of satisfaction  Do you enjoy cooking ?
So   what kind of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food , Italian   Indian   and Chinese  I ’ Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice
How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ? , Obviously   it depends on what I'm cooking   but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours
Yes   we do  We also eat a lot of lamb , yes  I ’ Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops
I certainly can  If I can get some from the butcher ’ s   I ’ ll cook them for you , That sounds great  I'll bring a bottle of wine
Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake ! , No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables
Ok  actually   I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots   buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower , I ’ ll remember that for next time  You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots   buy no broccoli or cauliflower  OK ?
Thank you   Rick  We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams   Brazil and China   face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round  Without a doubt   both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match , The ref signals the start of the game and here we go  Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball  Chen bumps it to the setter   and  a very nice set by Chen !
Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back   after a short commercial break , Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and   as always   I am joined by my partner in crime   Bob Copeland
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! , Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit   and Fernando Alonso takes the lead !
Not really  I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available   but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it  Sometimes   I ’ ll look at something in a shop   but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper  You don ’ t like buying things online   do you ? , No  I ’ m a little worried about security  You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords  Aren ’ t you worry about that ?
I do  I ’ m a big fan of using new technology   but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day  I think people need to get out and interact with other people , So   how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet
Ok  I ’ Ve finished online  Let ’ s go  I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card , Thanks for reminding me  I had forgotten to get mine
So   let ’ s see  You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls  You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries  The bath   shower   and washbasin are the same as before   aren ’ t they ? , Yes   they are  I gave them a good clean  They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced
I think you ’ Ve done a very good job  As least as good as a professional would do  Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? , You ’ ll be lucky ! However   I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself
I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision  I think I like the black leather suite  It ’ s on sale   isn't it ? , Yes  The price has been reduced by 50 %  It ’ s a real bargain
It ’ s quite large  It ’ s about 40 square metres , I ’ d suggest you buy two  That allows you to change the brightness of the room better
I think is looks great  I really like the light colors you have chosen  The pictures are nice too  Did you buy any new furniture ? , I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes  I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table
That wardrobe looks quite big  Is it full of clothes ? , Yes  I have some many clothes stuffed into it  Perhaps I should get rid of some of them  There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore
I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too  Perhaps we can go together one day , Ok  I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes
I ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe , You would fit both of them in your bedroom  Perhaps you could also get the dressing table  I think that one would look good in your bedroom
Yes  I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one  I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom , You can get cheap carpets easily  Another idea is to buy a rug  That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet  It would save you a lot of work
Yes   we do  The most popular vegetables are potatoes   carrots   peas   and cauliflower  The most popular fruit are apples   bananas   pears   peaches   grapes   and oranges  Do you like vegetables ? , I like them very much  We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country   buy we eat different kinds
I love eggplant ! Unfortunately   it ’ s quite expensive in my country   so I don ’ t eat it often , Why is it relatively expensive ?
We eat it in my country too   but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular  Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket , Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country   it ’ s very rare in mine
Ok   what do you want me to do ? , First of all   I need you to do the drying up  I ’ m almost finished the washing up  I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish
While you ’ re cleaning the cooker   I ’ ll wipe the worktop  That was a great meal   by the way , Actually   it was just some leftovers from yesterday  I made far too much food to eat alone  I am glad you could come over to help me finish it
Keep it and use it as rag  You can clean your bicycle with it , Have you seen Bill recently ?
You have to be very careful with seafood  It tastes lovely   but it often causes upset stomachs  Have you heard anything from Tom ? , He ’ s fine   but he had a fever last week  He probably just had a cold
It ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while  Thinking of all these ailments   I got a splinter the other day  It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin  Look , Oh   your hand is still sore  You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling
How do you use an ATM card   Billy ? , It ’ s easy grandpa  Insert you card into the machine here  Then wait a moment  Ok  Now you enter your PIN  It should have four numbers
Ok   I ’ Ve entered my PIN  There are several options on the screen  I guess I just choose which service I want   don ’ t I ? , Yes  Choose the service you need to use  If you choose to withdraw money   the machine will ask you how much you want
These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use  In fact   I quite like them  They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk , I ’ d like to send this parcel to Australia
That ’ s 850 grams  The coasts depends on how you would like to send it , I see  What are the options ? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail
Airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks , It that case   I ’ ll send it by airmail  I ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel
There ’ s you receipt  Goodbye , How can I help you ?
I ’ m supposed to be going to shanghai , Ok  When is your train supposed to leave ?
S M I T H , And your passport number ?
Is there anything you can do for me ? If I don ’ t make it to shanghai in time   my wife is going go kill me , Oh dear  I ’ m really sorry   sir  But you don ’ t have any proof of purchase  You ’ ll simply have to purchase another ticket
I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours ! , looks like you might like the soft sleeper then
Where ’ s my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! , Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket
Thanks   ma ’ am  You ’ re a lifesaver ! , Good afternoon  “ ginger ’ s restaurant ”  May I help you ?
We ’ ll be eight or nine people  Could we book a private room ? , I ’ ll just check  At what time on Friday evening ?
My name is Jenkins  My phone number is 7539738 2  that ’ s confirmed then  7 thirty on Friday , Yes  Do you intend to order a Lacarne or will you be having our seafood buffet ?
Where are we ? Oh   here we are  So we drive to the A120 and turn left , No   we turn right  Remember that we are coming from this direction
It ’ s only seven miles  We turn left to join the motorway and drive south , According to the map   we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25  That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London
Then we drive on the M25  it turns south  When we reach exit 15   we turn left and go west along the M4 , Then we take the first Heathrow Airport  What ’ s the total distance ?
It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance  Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way , We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic  I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there  Being early is much better than being late
Why ? , Well   my car won't start  I don't know what's the matter with it
Well   I suppose it could be the gas , No   there is plenty of gas  I filled it up yesterday
Excuse me   can you tell me the way to Holton railway station ? , Sure  It ’ s quite far from here  Don ’ t worry   though  It ’ s not difficult to get there
Yes   I do  They are about two miles away   right ? , That ’ s right  Drive back to the traffic rights and turn right  Follow the road for about a mile   until you see the plaza hotel  It ’ s a really big hotel  You can ’ t miss it  Turn left at the hotel
Ok  Got it  Thanks for you help , No problem
You see  I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful , Oh   shut up   will you ? It was all your fault  If you'd kept quite this would never have happened

Come on   darling  We haven't got much time , All right  I'm nearly ready  What time does the bus leave ?
We haven't  Hurry up ! , All right  Let's go
Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry   anyway ? , Well   I've got to stop and get gas in the car   first
Well   I'm not quite ready , I'll give you five more minutes   then I'm going on without you !
Why aren't you doing your homework ? , I'll do it later   Dad  I must prepare the concert on Saturday
You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday , Oh dad  You don't understand at all
Oh   don't you ? God save me ! , I'm sorry

Your house is very old  Does it need redecorating ? , Yes   it really needs redecorating
I have much time  I suppose it can be done , I ’ ll be glad if you would
Sure  Can I get to the central department stall this way ? , uh  Yes  Turn right   then take the second turning on your left
And do you know where the national bank is ? , Yes  It ’ s on this street  Keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right
Thank you  I won ’ t miss it , Is there anything wrong ?
I don ’ t mind that  But she disagrees with me about everything , You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself  You shouldn ’ t affect her decision
I guess you are right , Believe me  Everything will be ok
But yesterday you said you would rent it , I ’ Ve changed my mind
Maybe you ’ re right , You ’ re home late today   David  How was school ?

Have I really got to do those exams again   Dad ? , Of course   you have  You must try harder this time
But Dad   I should be working full-time at my age  I ’ m nearly 17 , You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams  You have to take a job and study
I am so busy today , Can I help you ?
Or maybe make the beds , All you have to do is ask for help
Jimmy   I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party  What do you think of it ? , Don ’ t dress like that  You ’ ll make fool yourself  You look stupid in that robe
What am I going to do ? , Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you

All right   but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see   sir , Mike ! Look at the floor !
Oh , It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes
My cigarettes , Well   they ' re not here  They are in the dustbin
Well   let's see  Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time , Well   to tell the truth   I don't really feel like it tonight  I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired
Well   do you have any suggestions ? , Let's see  How do you feel about playing bridge ?
OK , Hello   Janet  It's me  Oh   fine  Just fine  Say   Janet   I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight  No ? Well  would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
What's the matter ? , It's not what I asked for
This is a pity ! , So   what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new   isn ’ t it ?
Yes  You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients , Did you buy new cupboards too ?
Yes   I have  I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make  I need a little more practice before I invite guests over , Looking at the spice rack   I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food
I hope you can stay for dinner  I need a guinea pig ! , Sorry  What was that you said ?
At the Gate , When   did you say ?
Peter  Peter Brown   you know  Don't forget to bring the letter , Sorry  I didn't quite catch what you said  There's a lot of noise outside
We'd like to rent a flat near the university , Are you looking for somewhere for two people ?
Not really   no  We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street , How many rooms do you need in the flat ?
How far away is it from the campus ? , It's about two miles away  that might be a little far to walk  Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus  The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street   just off a main street
Thank you  That would be great , Can you assure the quality of this air conditioner ?
You don't have to worry about it  We have a one year warranty , Are you sure ?
It should be close to the university  Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is   the later we can get up , Absolutely  That's the most important thing to take into consideration  I'm not too worried about the size of the flat
Good point  Ok   let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us , Yes   if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days  I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early
I like this apartment  Do you think we can afford the mortgage ? , Yes  I think so  It ’ s not a very expensive apartment  It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for  The rooms are quite large too
Yes   and there are many houses nearby  I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks , It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house  A garden would be so nice
Yes   everything has been well designed , So   tell me about you new house  How is it different to your old one ?
Yes  One bedroom is for my wife and I  there ’ s another for our daughter  My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room   but I ’ d like to make it into a study  Our daughter is also keen on making it a study   so that ’ s probably what will happen , What ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook
Yes   they are  That ’ s very important to us  We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light  Each room has large windows , Do you have a balcony ?
It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood  There ’ s some traffic   but not much  It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre   but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost  So when are you going to drop by ? , I don't know how to adjust my life  Would you give me a piece of advice ?
You should get plenty of sleep , I drink a lot of wine
You better do some exercise every morning , I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me
Sure  If you want to stretch your legs   a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body   like this  It ’ s a very simple exercise   but very effective , I need to excise my arms too  How can I do that ?
You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much  Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle  The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight  Many people bend their bodies at the waist   which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise , What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?
Yes   you do  Lift the weight up   keeping your arms straight all the time , Great  Thanks for you advice !
But I want to watch TV now , That ’ s out of the question
Not even for an hour ? , Sorry   it ’ s impossible
I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it  I must have left it somewhere  I hope I haven ’ t lost it , Perhaps you left that at school
Yes   I ’ d better give her a call now , But she can ’ t be home now  She might have gone to the library
Ok  I ’ m really bored at the moment , Ok  This man is tall and slim  He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair
Sounds like Mike   is it ? , Yes   it is  You describe someone we both know
Well   I don't find her attractive   but I'm sure you will disagree , I like slim girls   so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive  You ’ ll have to give me some more information
She ’ s your mother ! , How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ?
Well   you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey   I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me ! , Shall we have some soup first ?
Meat   I think , Don't you like fish then ?
Yes   but I prefer red wine with meat , What would you like for dessert ?
No   thanks  I'd like to go straight home  I'm very tired , Excuse me
Medium rare   that ’ s right   sir  I remember your order , Well   I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t  It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough  Would you mind changing ?
You say he was around average hight , Yes   that's right   around five nine five ten
Any marks on his face ? , No   I don't think so
what about his hair ? , Black or dark brown
Boy   this surely doesn't help us much  It could be anybody  How about his cloth ? What was he wearing , Well   he had a jacked or a plage shirt  You know the kind of number jack wear
What kind of shoes ? , Boots
All right  That Nealy done a little , Now I want you to look some pictures
I'd rather get one with separated speakers  They give a clear sound , Yes   but we shouldn't get any thing too big  Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture
Yes   sir  May I help you ? , Please I'd like a ticket to New York
We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM  Is that ok ? , Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at 9 thirty
How about afternoon ? , Sounds not good  I won't take it
The chicken is also nice , No   I want the fish
Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb , No   I like the fish
Yes ? , I'm afraid you can't smoke here
I'm sorry  I can't  What does the note say , It says ' No smoking '
Yes   I'm going to the cinema   dad , You mustn't go to bed very late  Can you be home before nine
Oh   dad   I'm not a child  I'm 17 already  I'll come back as soon as the film is over , OK  Here's the key  Take care
Really   it's so beautiful , You like it  Well   I'll gather in for you
It's a private garden , I wonder if you could help me   I'm looking for a room
Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry , Would it be convenient to see the room ?
Yes  I'm looking for an apartment   I'd like two bedrooms , All right  Have a seat   please  Let me ask you a few questions  First of all   may I have your name   please ?
It's E-A-K-I-N-S , E-A-K-I-N-SFirst name   Donald  And what's your present address   MrEakins ?

No   you mustn't sit on the grass  Don't you see the notes ? , Yes   I can see it  But what's on it ?
Be careful  You can't smoke here , Why not ?
Yeah   Please do  Now let me show you the house , This seems a pretty nice room   I should say
It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen  The stove and the ice-box are in good order   and the plumbing is OK   too , I see  I'd like to live here for about three years
Good morning   sir , Good morning
How about your sideburns ? , Just to the bottom of my ears  By the way   I'd like a shave   too

What sort of pest are we dealing with ? , We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything  We have termites in the wood   cockroaches all over the place   and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard !

What would you like to return ? , I'm returning a cellphone
What isn't working on it ? , It keeps turning off on it's own
I'm going to take care of this and refund your money , Thanks for your help
Yeah   I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills   but first I have to separate them into little piles , Ok   I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies
Oh yeah   those are from my trip to London  I have a couple of different pence   but in all it won't add up to one pound , Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ?
No ! , Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday
Ok   but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral , Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me
True  I always see him drinking instant , Let's take him some of Kitty's best and make the pitch again
Johnny   I want to thank you , What do you mean   Mom ? For breaking your best china ?
I know   and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house  So   thank you , Am I back in your good books ?
No   but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world  Careful   hold it by the java jacket  This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ? , It tastes funny  Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ?
Here's some water  Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol , Uh ! I can't swallow them   Mom !
Here   I'll break them up   so they're smaller  And here's some cough syrup , Yuck !
It's a small , How is the condition ? How old is it ?
I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back  Good luck ! I hope it will fit you ! , Mom !
You are sick   young lady  Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today   so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! , But I feel better
Guess what   Gilly ? I won both bids , Good for you  Did you use Paypal ?
I should get the items within a week  But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera , How much ?
Ouch ! The water's too hot ! , Get in slowly   sweetie  You'll get used to it  I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup
Oh  I'm sweating already  It's so hot  I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? , That's a good sign  But just soak a little longer   OK ?
The ad said rent was thirty thousand  That includes utilities and phone   I assume , No   it doesn't  And there's a maintenance fee for each month  It's forty NT per ping
You bet it is  And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome ! , Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing
Come on baby   let's dance ! , Oops ! It's the landlord  I guess the tables have turned now  We're the noisy neighbors  Turn it down !
I thought so   by the looks on your faces when you left  So why don't you come to my apartment   and we'll settle all the details , OK  How does seven o'clock this evening sound ?
And this espresso looks like  oil ! , It still tastes fine   though
So how long do you plan to live here ? , We'd like to sign a year-long contract   if that's OK
Great  When in Rome   you guys know what to do , We'll sign our signatures   too  And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers
I can take two thousand off  That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand , That's great  Every little bit counts  And we don't need the parking space  I guess we could rent it out
I'm glad  Now   there's a deposit fee of two month's rent , Ann   stop bugging Jess and help me order something new  Lattes are so passe these days
Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee , Sounds better   but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head
Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again , I could use one   too  I'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign
What a girly drink  I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva , You and your fancy Italian names
And I'll stick with real coffee , This motor oil case is still really slippery
By the way   I heard Kitty's just got in a shipment of Jamaican Blue Mountain , So what ?
Sure you can  But I'm only gonna keep it for a month , Why ? It's in mint condition !
You bet  eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT  This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans , I've created a monster  you're a better bayer than me !
You never know when two might turn into three , I guess you're right  And we'd like to have company anyway
Oh   well  It was fun to be the winner  But  it's too big  I must be an extra small in the States , So what about the tennis racket ?
Oh  around twenty bucks  A bargain if you ask me  Look at the picture of her playing with it ! , Hey   two for one  That's a super deal
This one is  I have another one that's furnished   but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture , We have tons of furniture  What we need are air conditioners
And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer  Come and see , I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer !
And the stove is brand new  You know how to use a gas stove   right ? , Yes  We've lived in Taiwan for a while  I had a gas stove in the States   too
They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other ! , What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open !
With the shipping included--seventy dollars , Hmm  not so hot  They sell them here for about that
Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains   fresh air ! Stars ? , This balcony is perfect for barbecuing
Well   fish it will be then , Great  My favorite-soup   soup   soup
Well   you do that when your nose needs blowing  I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster , No   please   Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater !
Easy for you to say  My bottom still stings , It might be sore for a while  You'll be OK  Now let's go home and rest
No   thanks , And vegetables with porridge
Oh   you can rest assured that they'll be no problem , Why is that ?
Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town  When they're here   they're usually sleeping  And next door to you is me  I'm a quiet neighbor , Sounds ideal  We'll get back to you in a couple of days then
No   I'm fine  I don't need to see a doctor , Then I guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school
Chicken soup again ? , Soup does the body good   sweetie  It's what you need when you're under the weather
Then review for your test  You'll do even better  And maybe reading will help you get to sleep , Aw   Mom-you're such a drag
Don't be so dramatic  You're such a baby  Now sit down and finish your soup , OK   OK
Well   the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen   and their soup isn't as tasty as mine ! , Johnny   are you just sitting around again ?
I'm doing my best   Grandma , Your best isn't good enough  Back in my day   I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit   and it'd be twice as clean as this sty !
I know   Grandma   I just , You're darn Toomin '   you know ! Now   you're on housework duty while I'm here !
Yes'm , And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
It was a pleasure   Mrs  Robinson , And this kitchen is so clean  Did you help Johnny with that ?
Yeah   uh   it's outside  Listen   I really have to be going now , Thanks for your help !
It fell out of the garbage bag , What was it doing there ?
I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us , Can you fix me a cup of tea   Johnny ?
Oh   yeah  Well   uh   about your mug , I'll find it  Where are all the floral pattern plates ? And dad's Yankee's mug ?
What time is it anyway ? , Nine-thirty
OK   emergency measures  Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone , Little dude   your life is over !
Yes   I hear about it every time she comes here , She was the head janitor at St  Mary's Hospital for thirty years   after all
I think she just likes to make us miserable , You could be right
All my games are so lame   Mom  When can I get a new one ? , Well   listen   Honey   you've been a big help lately
I knew there would be a catch ! , Nothing in life is free   Son
It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food   so I thought you might want to try , That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish
There are many amazing dishes to choose from  We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry  It ' s a bit spicy   but I think you can handle it , Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food
They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter   vegetable samosas or daal , It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait !
I just can't stand it  It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat   and the floor was wet and slippery  So I cleaned it ! , You did what ? Helen   I know it's gross   but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse  Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ?
Hang on  I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor , You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here !
Well   this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand  First of all   what is this FICA   and SUI Y tax   and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? , OK   let's start from the top of your pay stub  This number here represents your gross pay
That's right  Below the federal deductions are the state deductions  There's the state income tax   and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up   but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take , Yeah   I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that  So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ?
No problem ! All those deductions do add up   and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like  I can understand why you'd want some explanation , Yeah   I guess it's the same in the UK   I just never paid much attention  See you later !
I ' m sorry sir   but we ran out of chicken  May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos , Sure I ' ll have the burrito  Do you have nachos ?
Would you like anything to drink ? , Sure   I ' ll have a Corona
Yeah here you go  Actually I also want to return this keyboard , Ok  may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work , I am sorry mam   but we can only exchange or refund defective products   we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages
“ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog  ” , Trev   are you OK ?
No sweat  Just go back and talk him down  Here comes Wei , Hey Julie   you want to go grab something to eat ?
Oh  OK  I don't eat meat   but that's fine   I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? , I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
A vegan  I don't eat or use any animal based products  I don't wear leather   eat eggs   drink milk or anything that comes from an animal  I used to be a pescatarian before   which basically means you don't eat meat   but still have fish and seafood , Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
What a find ! So   how much does it cost ? , Well   because I like you  ninety bucks
Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later , Johnny   have you tidied up your room yet ?
Oh   my God   I forgot grandma's coming ! , Yes   so this place had better be clean  You know Grandma
Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old , Really ? It almost looks brand new  And the color designs are so retro
This is one of my favorite items , How did you get it ?
Uh   I'm not sure  Are these all in good condition ? , Absolutely  I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks
Oh   why not ? I'll take ' em , Hello  Do you like this jewelry ? I made most of these items myself
Me   too  But I could never make bracelets like these , I've been making these designs for over ten years  You can have a bracelet for ten dollars
Why didn't you text me last night ? , What ? I sent you three or four messages !
Well   because I didn't have any credit on my phone  I used it all up this month , I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ?
Bruno Bistro   how may I help you ? , Yes   hello   I would like to make a reservation please
I'm sorry sir   but we are fully booked tonight until eight , In that case   eight o'clock is fine
Lastly   may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ? , Mark
I was thinking of getting a hamburger   fries and a chocolate sundae , You eat too much junk food  That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol
How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! Better yet   let's order some hot dogs ! , You are a lost cause
OK   so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven   that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything  Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit , Got it
Go ahead and use the mixer   but put it on medium speed  I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients , OK   so now we need a baking pan right ?
We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes  Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan , Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought !
How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ? , It wasn't too crowded   but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together   then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym   but I didn't fit
You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! , What's for dinner ?
From last night ! I took the left over turkey   mixed it with some diced peppers and onions   added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! , Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ?
Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money   but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! , Thank you for coming tonight   Mrs  Webber  As a teacher   it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night
I guess he gets that from me   I never did well in math when I was a kid  What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom , Well   it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math  I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions  It will really help a lot
Oh yes   I , Welcome to Al's Bakery  What can I get you ?
No   that's OK  Do you have any whole wheat bread ? , We are out at the moment  May I suggest some rye bread ?
I'll just take a cheesecake , Will that be all ?
Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say , Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called   and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back
Ok   so how about this   " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can   so please leave me your name and number  Talk to you soon ! " , A little too friendly Abby  Just say this   " Hi   you have reached Abby  I am unable to answer your call right now   but if you leave me your name and phone number   I will get back to you as soon as possible  Thanks "
Let's have a look  What is this ? Where are all the grades ? , He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school   he receives a mark from one to three  A one means his achievement or work is excellent  Here in Science for example he got a two   which means its satisfactory
So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F ! , What did you cook ?
Ok   for starters we have Tom Yam soup  It's a bit spicy   but really good ! , This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !
Ok   now for the last and best dish in my opinion  This is called Pad Thai  It's stir-fried noodles with eggs   fish sauce   tamarind juice   red chili pepper plus bean sprouts   shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander  It's practically Thailand's national dish ! , Wow   this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious !
What are you doing this weekend ? , My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me
Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny , Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife
You lost me , I'll explain later   let's go
Very well  Let's see   according to his vaccination record   Ricky has received his Polio   Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots  He is 14 months old   so he is due for Hepatitis A   Chickenpox and Measles shots , What about Rubella and Mumps ?
We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well  Now   please hold Ricky's arm tight   this may sting a little , Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online
I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art  The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb   the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! , Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra   in Jordan   Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico
Good idea ! , I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids
Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction , Well   first of all   I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way  I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses
Good luck with that ! , Good afternoon Sir   may I please see your passport and reservation ?
Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? , We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this  If your flight is urgent   I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening   but it's on a first come first served basis   so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight
That's fine  I'll do that then , Thank you for your understanding sir  I will book your flight now
You should get acupuncture treatment  My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her , The results are too slow  On top of that   just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me
The needles are very thin   and as long as the doctor's technique is good   and the patient himself is relaxed   it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain  Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all  However   if you are really scared of acupuncture   scraping or cupping are also options , Scraping is too terrifying  When they finish scrapping   your body is all red   as if you were just tortured  Cupping is the same   your body ends up with red circles all over  It looks like someone beat you up
This is the only way to get at the problem  Anyway   if you want to relieve the pain   you are just going to have to be tough and do it , Forget it  I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself  In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap
OK   do you know what kind of food will be served ? , Well   his wife is Japanese  He said she makes really good sushi
No   I don't think so  Sushi is a very delicately flavored food   and red wine would be a jarring contrast  You need a white wine   which has more subtle flavors   to complement the fish , I see  So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine   right ?
That's another varietal   or type of grape   just like Chardonnay , Let's see  The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp   mineral flavors and a bonedry finish  Serve chilled  " Oh   no   how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now
Well   this is a French wine   so they don't always specify the varietal on the label  The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine  This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes   mostly Viognier   I'd guess , And you think this is a good wine ?
Whoa ! This is a massive flea market ! , You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here
You can't buy much more   Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan , Oh   yeah  OK  I'll just buy smallthings !
Not at all   guys also get facials   manicures and pedicures  There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good , True  So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ?
Well you should come with me one day   I'm sure you'll love it , Uh  no
But you could have saved money , From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it  Plus   I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight ? , I can't   I have to go to the gym
That's cool   does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ? , Yeah  He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on   or the muscles I want to build  Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs   pecs and biceps   he makes me work out with free weights  Then for my quads   calves and hamstrings   I do leg lifts or squats
Are you looking for anything else ? , Um   let me see  Hmm  This antique tea set here is gorgeous
And these old Dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set  Have them , Gee ! I don't know what to say ! Thanks so much
That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland , It sounds like a special quilt  Why do you want to sell it ?

Let ’ s get started ! , Let ’ s start with the basics   bread  Bread is an important ingredient here  You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria   freshness   crumb and color  If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven   or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color
Last but not least   we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich  We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper   or we can combine mustard sauce   mayonnaise   ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! , That ’ s all the time we have for today   but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time !

This model features anti-lock brakes   airbags on both driver and passenger sides   and impact collision design  But that's not all  This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical , You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ?
Why don't you take it for a test drive   and think it over , I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it  What ’ s worse   I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops  Sometimes   they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for  Last week   they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed  You know   my car is just half a year old and also good brand  I was just wondering about all these
Yes   there is  Those organizations exist  You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help , Excuse me   can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ?

No   not the really   don't worry about it   like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing   so just follow the crowd   There's only one direction to go   so you won't get on the wrong train  Head north on the Yellow line   and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops , This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service  It is quick and accurate
Yes   therefore they are expanding the scope of their service  For example   hotels can be booked through the same site as well , The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
Yeah you are right  This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded , I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him
Some Chinese food  I ’ m hungry   and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here  We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat , No   I ’ d rather go out  The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home  Maybe we can try some other food today  What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day   the one over in the shopping center ?
Yes   their steaks are enormous  Sometimes I can ’ t finish what I ’ Ve ordered , What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste

There are many interesting places you should be sure to see  One problem is transportation   however  Because the city is very old   the roads are narrow and congested  If you only have three or four days to visit   you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab  I suggest you take the subway , The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day

I ’ Ve got all the presents I need   and my family is working together to get all the food ready  That ’ s easy ; but I have another problem to deal with , What ’ s that ? Don ’ t tell me you ’ Ve still got Christmas cards to write   it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours
Yes  He ’ s never said anything so I never told him  But now that he ’ s getting older , You think it ’ s better that he should be told ?
I can understand  I was lucky with my oldest ; she figured it out by herself and didn ’ t tell my son , Well   when you tell him   be gentle  It ’ s hard for kids to find out something like that
Come on   it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging , It ’ s not that bad   besides it really looks nice in that corner  It gives the room a good atmosphere
But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it , I know   but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away
Yeah   it was a good Christmas  It won ’ t always be this good   but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should , Ok   fine  We need to take down the tree
Have you got anything cheaper ? , Sorry  I think that's the cheapest
All right  I think I'll take it , Do you know the circulation of this magazine ?
Over 2 million , I don ’ t want you to be worried   but our son has some bad habits now  He says painful words everyday
Honey   I don ’ t know what to tell you  Of course Tony is a young child  But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason , Yes   but sometimes he is just not reasonable
Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior  Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods   etc  Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire , I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him  But this doesn ’ t work   instead he picks up another bad habit
I do it   too  You know   sometimes when we eat   my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat  And if it were something he doesn ’ t like   he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes  He does it very often  I really get mad  I can ’ t help spank him sometimes , And what does your husband do ?
Yeah  I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper  My child is almost two years old   and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something , Who finances the magazine ?
Yes   so it really doesn't matter who offers the moneyThe paper itself is profitable , Good morning

It's not really all that goodThe bedroom is a little small for us , Small ? But it should be enough for our needs   I think
True   and I like the kitchenIt ' s new and well equipped , It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park
I haven't thought of that , This apartment is wonderful
The rent is $ 1050 each month , That ’ s way too much money
I can ’ t take that , I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850
If you can ’ t afford $ 1050   then we have no deal , Do you like cooking ?
You can ask the guests for help  My guests usually insist on doing the washing up  I just have to remind them where everything goes , So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food

OK  I like the design of this lamps  I also need some cushion covers  I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there , This house is not looking all that great from here
I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better , It is just too dark in here with so few windows

Great  It was a pleasure doing business with you , I heard that you finished my home inspection   and I was wondering how it went
I went there to check for problems with the home   so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in , Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?
You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems , What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night  The house will be yours at that time , What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ?
Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint  It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived , I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in
I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you  Here   feel how hot my head is ! , Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ?
I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through , I asked the owners   and they said that everything was great with the house
I inform you of the problems  If there are major problems   you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems , What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ?
You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night  When you actually move in is up to you , Will the electricity and water be on   or do we need to do something to get it turned on ?
An empty house is easier to paint and clean  Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in , I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house
My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day , Hello   I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager
Yes   it's still vacant  Are you interested in seeing it ? , Yes   I would love to see the apartment
Great  I'll see you at 6  Do you know where it is ? , Yes   I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood
No  I might need to see your ID card   but that's about it , I came in to see how my home inspection went
I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it , The owner said that the roof had leaked   but that he got it fixed last month
The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed   or maybe the price of the house can be reduced , Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ?
The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday   so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday , Will the utilities be turned on ?
If I were you   I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in , I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in
I think that I have something else really important to do on that day  I just can ’ t remember what it is , so   what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new   isn ’ t it ?
yes  You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients , Did you buy new cupboards too ?
yes   I have  I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make  I need a little more practice before I invite guests over , I'd like to speak with the apartment manager   please
It's still available  Do you want to see it ? , Yes   I would very much like to see it
Okay   I'll see you at 6 o'clock  Do you need any directions ? , No   thanks  I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like
No  I only need to check your driver's license , can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time
ok  I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them  Where is the tea towel ? Oh   here it is , we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it
my pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged  Do you have another one ? , yes  Look in that drawer  I should throw the old one out
That looks good  The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom   so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room , I ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe
Everything in this magazine seems expensive  You could probably find something similar in a discount store , Yes  I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one  I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom
I have redecorated my bedroom  I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures  I also bought a new pair of curtains  What do you think of it ? , I think is looks great  I really like the light colors you have chosen  The pictures are nice too  Did you bought any new furniture ?
do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? , that wardrobe looks quite big  Is it full of clothes ?
that ’ s a good idea  After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear   I can see what new clothes I need to buy , I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too  Perhaps we can go together one day
I did it myself  I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement  Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed  I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys , so   let ’ s see  You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls  You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries  The bath   shower and waterbasin are the sam
as I hadn ’ t done it before   I had to keep referring to information I got from the internet  Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening  The , I think you ’ Ve done a very good job  As least as good as a professional would do  Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
We eat a lot of chicken   pork and beefYou eat those meat a lot in your country too   don ’ t you ? , Yes   we doWe also eat a lot of lamb
Yes   I have  I tried them when I visited your country last year  I thought they were very tastyCan you cook them ? , I certainly canIf I can get some from the butchers   I ’ ll cook them for you
Well   I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat  I ’ Ve got pork chops   small steaks   chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties , I can ’ t wait to start cooking  I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoalDo you have enough plates and utensils ?
They sell them at the shop around the cornerWe can go and get some in a few minutes , I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogsWe ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce
It only takes a few minutesSome people like their meat well done   others like it rareThe great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked , They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it
excellent  Come in please  The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs  It keeps breaking down , when did it first break down ?
yes   it ’ s still under warranty  Over the last few weeks   it ’ s also been making a high - pitch noise when it ’ s in use , ok  I ’ ll start by looking at the motor  I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine  oh   yes  There ’ s the problem  It ’ s quite simple  I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes
that ’ s great  Thanks very much  Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? , Hi   you said that you might need some help with preparing dinnerWhat would you like me to do ?
After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables   could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oilFry the meat until it is cooked   then we will add some spices to flavor it , Which spices are you going to add to the meat ?
Cook it over a high flame   so that it will be ready quicklyKeep stirring the meat around the frying panDon ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan , RightWhat are you doing over there ?
You don ’ t have to eat them  I don ’ t mind , Thanks   MomCan I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake
You can have some fruits for dessertIf you eat an apple and a banana   I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake , Ok   actually I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrotsBut I hate broccoli and cauliflower
What would you like for dessert ? , What do you have ?
Of course  I made the apple pie this morning   so it ’ s lovely and fresh , I love your home-made apple pieIt ’ s deliciousCan I have another glass of lemonade as well ?

I can afford about $ 800 a month for rent , That ’ s not high enough
That ’ s almost perfect , I can live with that too
Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? , Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate

It's time for bed , But I'm not sleepy   Mum  Can I stay and watch more TV ?

Oh   I see , All right  I ’ m glad I could clarify things for you
Absolutely  That's the most important thing to take into consideration  I'm not too worried about the size of the flat , Neither am I  So a small place is ok   but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive  Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
Yes   if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days  I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early , How much do you think the rent will be ?

Does it have automatic transmission ? , Yes   and it also has power steering   power brakes   and air conditioning
I got stuck in traffic again  There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection , it's always rather congested down there during rush hour  Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home
I think it's something that I'll have to consider  The public transport system is pretty good , it would be better for the environment   too
the only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car , well   when it's nicer outside   you can start biking to work  That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides
yes   it's not good for me or for the environment , we'd like to rent a flat near the university
yes   there are several place available in that price range near the university  do you have any other requirements ? , net really   no  we'd preferably like to live in a quiet street
ok  i've got a list of place that fit your requirements  let's just go through them  the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month   but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from t , how far away is it from the campus ?
of course  i'm not very busy at the moment  if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes  i can take you there , thank you  that would be great
I love the balcony  We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer  We are on the 12th floor   so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony , The neighbourhood is nice too  There is a park nearby
Yes   it would  Don ’ t worry  There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby  This place will be fine , The building is quite new and well constructed  I ’ m happy with the fittings too

Great  Would you like coffee or tea with that ? , I'll have a cup of tea

is that your rabbit ? , yes   I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend
rabbits aren't usually that affectionate   are they ? , if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young   they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats
that sounds pretty easy  Do rabbits make your house smell ? , No   rabbits aren't very stinky  As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis   it's not too bad
that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? , not yet  She's pretty tame  I think she must be used to being around lots of different people

Me   too , Buy them now though   or they might not still be here tomorrow
yes   doesn't everyone ? , what's your favorite animal ?
when I was little   we had a few domestic dogs at home , they always say that dogs are a man's best friends  do you think that's true ?
i had one a few months ago   but she ended up running away , how did that happen ?
i was pretty sad  i still hope that she'll return some day ! , I hope she does  Do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
i do   too , when do most children start school in your country ?
Kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day   but after that   they spend about eight hours in school every day , do they have to go to school on Saturdays ?
In most schools   they study about nine subjects , do students have to wear uniforms in schools in America ?
I went to a private school for elementary school and university   but went to a public school for high school  What about you ? , I went to a boarding school from nursery school to senior high school
at least you didn't waste time thinking about what you were going to wear every day ! , that's true !
But I exercise at the club  And I use the stepping machineSo I need good running shoes , That's not the sameMaybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes   but not real running shoes
And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? , They look like running shoesThey have the same shape  And you can use them for running tooBut they're not so serious  They aren't designed for serious runnersYou can use them for exerce
That's what I wantFor exercising at the club  I can even spend 100 dollars on them  I don't care , But it's a waste of money  You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines  It's just a waste of money
I want the bestMy sister said good shoes are very important  For support  They support your feet , Your sister is a fitness expert   huh ?
Here it is  This is what my sister has , Yes   that's it  That's their top model
Here in America   it's six , Well   here you are  Size six  Woman's  137 dollarsWow   what a waste of money !
I've always got room for something sweet ! , what are you going to try first ?
I believe they add locally produced honey to it , that sounds good  I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu
what do you think ? How does it taste ? , it's nice   but it's rather plain  Do you want to try my tiramisu ?
it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had ! , I'm glad you like it  I don't care for it  Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ?
I believe they are a local delicacy in the South , do you want me to get you one   too ?
I like the Honda Accord you showed me before  I think it's more practical for my needs , Alright   sir  You are making a good choiceHonda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord
Cruise control ? I don't like that , Why not   sir ?
I wish it didn't have cruise control  My wife doesn't like it either , You know   sir   you don't have to use itYou can turn it on or off  If you don't want to use it   you just never turn it on
I see  Another important question is the time I can get this car  I need a new car rather soon , Well   I can say that the new models will be here in AugustIf you order one now   we will have it for you in August
My brother has last year's AccordAnd his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver  I really like that color  I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord , I know the color you mean  Is this it   sir ?
Well   I think I want to order the new Accord thenIt looks like an excellent car , You have made a good choice   sir  I drive an Accord myself  They are very solidly built machines   very reliable
Why don't we get you some shirts ? , I want to leave  We've already been here two hours
Why ? They have everything here , I don't like shopping in malls  I like shopping on the street  There is more variety
What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ? , The styles here are too boring for me  I told you  I like street shopping
Here  Look at this shirt  Try it on , Do they have it in LARGE
The fitting rooms are over there , Okay   I will try it on
No   it looks greatWhy are you always like this when you're shopping ? You know it looks good , Well   I don't think it's the best style for me
You should be happy I want you to look goodIf I let you shop for yourself   you would never buy anything , Yes   maybe  But I like street shopping  There is more variety  I'm sorry  I just don't like malls
What instructions ? , We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table
Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? , Of courseFirst   you must sand the furniture  You sand it to make the wood smoothYou start with heavy-grade sandpaper  Then   you move to finer-grade sandpaper
Alright , Then   after you sand it   you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust
That makes sense , Then you apply the varnish   which is very easy  It is like painting
And after the varnish ? , After the varnish dries for 24 hours   you can put another coat of varnish on  Or you can put the finish onThe finish is hard and clear  It goes on top of the varnish
It all sounds very complicated , It only sounds complicated  It's really very easy  A lot of people here in America finish their own furnitureIt ' s a good way to save some money  And a lot of people even enjoy it
How can I help you ? , Yes   I would like to look at some of your products
Well   you made a good choice  Coming to us   I meanWe have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers , What do you have in foundation ?

What should I get Uncle Teddy ? , You could get him a tie
Everybody gets men ties for Christmas  It's too boring  Everybody buys either ties or sweaters  I want a more unique gift , Well   you can buy him a pet iguana then
Yes  An iguana is too strange for a gift   and a tie is too normalSo I have to find something halfway between , How much do you want to spend ?
Yes , Well   he isn't a lawyer   so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that
I think that's a great idea  Men look great with that kind of bagWhere can we buy one ? , I don't think this mall has a leather goods storeSo we have to go to State Street
Good plan  What should we get for Mom though ? , She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers  I think they sell them at Sears
I think it would be a great jokeBut I know we'd have to take the iguana back  And the pet store might not let usSo why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe , A tie ?
May I help you   sir ? , Yes   I want to buy a VCR

May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ? , DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ?
For one thing   sir   the quality of the image is usually betterThat ' s because it's digital , But isn't it more expensive ?

I don't want Macintosh  I want PC , I'm sorry   but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment
But nobody uses Macintosh ! , That's not trueMost of the students and professors in the university here use MacintoshThey find it is better for writing and word-processing   and that is what students mostly do  Ma
But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese , There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with MacintoshChinese is no problem for Apple

No   I don't  You look pretty busy today  Do you have an opening for me ? , Yes   we do  I can cut your hair right now if you likeDo you need a shampoo too   or just a haircut ?
Well   I last had a haircut eight weeks ago  So my hair is pretty longBut I want the same style , I recommend you leave it a little long on topBut we should take in the back and sides a bit more  That's more fashionable now
Fine , And do you usually part your hair along here ?
Yes   I know my hair is quite thinIt runs in my family  Everybody has very thin hair , The problem is the split ends  They make your hair look even more frizzy
Do you sell conditioner here ? , Of course  I have one I can suggest
I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking , We should plan to move out of here before July  I'm tired of living in apartments
Not necessarily  If we use a realtor to find a house   it will be more expensive , What do you mean ?
Yes   that's often true  But you have to pay them , I still think we should have a realtorWe ' re new in this country  We don't know all the laws of buying a houseAnd also   the realtor will inspect the houseHe can tell us if the house has
It takes a little more time  We have to check the ads in the paperProbably also there are special real estate magazines with adsThen we have to drive to the homes and look at them , And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
Because if the seller has a realtor   their price will be higherHe will have to pay a commission to the realtor , Hmm  It all sounds very complicated
Alright  I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store , are you good at cooking ?
well   to be honest with you   Chinese food is really different from western food , are you used to the food here ?
like most foreigners   I really like Sweet and Sour Pork and Kung Pao Chicken  I eat them almost every day , have you tried traditional Chinese dumplings yet ?
that's good to know  I'd like to try more Chinese food   but since I can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home   it's difficult to try new food , if you want   I can introduce you to some typical Chinese dishes

What do you mean ? , I mean   do you want the best quality   or do you want good prices ?
What are those stores ? , They are very large   discount department storesThat means their prices are very goodAnd you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom

We appreciate your business   Ma'am , Morgan   can I ask you a question ?
in most cities in China   doggie bags are quite uncommon , what happen to all the leftover food ?
ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China  You know   in the past   people could not afford to eat out like they can today , I guess that makes sense  I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home
I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet  I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them , many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet   but my parents grew up eating them   so I think they are OK
do you like cooking   Julia ? , I really enjoy it   especially when it ends up tasting good !
that's a lot of cooking  You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much , I do  If you cook at home   you can eat healthy food cheaply
do you make a lot of traditional British food ? , aside from the Sunday roast   we usually eat dangers and mash   toad-in-the-hole   or fish'n chips once a week
what's your favorite dish to make ? , I absolutely love making mousaka   which is a Greek dish with eggplant  But it takes a lot of time   so I don ’ t often make it
I don't really like coffee   to be honest  It's too bitter for me , well   you need something to wake you up  How about a soda ?
I like diet sprite  Does that have any caffeine in it ? , unfortunately   it doesn't  how about some diet coke ?
maybe  How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? , you'll love that  It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup
do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? , no   I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something  How about you ?

I bought all the ingredients this morning   so let's start ! , what do we do first ?

I'll prepare it  Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? , white rice   please  None of that healthy brown stuff for me !
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas , I ’ m glad this car is an automatic  I don't like having to change gears
very funny  Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror  Can you see out of them ? , I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car  Could you move it forward a bit   please ?
check your petrol situation , the tank is almost empty  I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up

Yeah   I know  Shop till you drop , Right !
Hey   Jeanine   get a load of that  It's beautiful , Ahahah   and I thought you were tired
Sure does  Hey   can I sponge a little cash of you ? , Don't worry   Marian   I've got you covered
yes   you sent them to New York   right ? , that's right  I thought I'd come back to buy some more souvenirs
we have plenty of postcards to choose from here  The same designs can be found on these posters , posters are difficult to travel with  I think I'll just buy the postcards  I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice

come off it   It's not that serious  You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime , Fat chance   I'm too scared of bungee jumping
I can teach you how , I had a sneaking suspicion about you   Eric   I think you've lost it

that ’ s a really long line  How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? , it takes about 3 minutes per person   so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait

she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No  5  But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance , ok   here are some of our most popular perfumes
that smells great  I'll take one bottle   please , would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers
she doesn't usually wear lipstick  She thinks it makes her nose look too big , how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger
no thanks  Western women usually try to make their skin darker   no lighter , will that be all then ?
yeah   I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long  I'm starving ! , let's take a look at the menu so we can order  Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
well   let's get a plate of those then , sounds good  What are you going to have for your main course ?
it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice , that sounds nice  Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
I think I'll have a beer , ok   shall I flag down the waitress ?
what would you do without me ? , can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding
that will probably be quite expensive   but the more you pay for the fabric   the longer it'll last and the better it'll look  What color do you want the suit to be ? , I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit
why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral   a wedding   a job interview — anything ! , that may be true   but black is so boring  Anyway   I already have three black suits  I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest
how about this one ? , I think that will do  Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made
don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? , yeah   maybe you ’ re right  How about this outfit ?
I like the jeans   but you need something to go with the top  It ’ s too plain on its own , how about this scarf   these earrings   and an anklet ?
thanks  You ’ d be ok on your own  There are loads of fashion victims out there   and you are not one of them  Have you tried it on yet ? , yep  Here it is  What do you think ?
no   they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing , that ’ s even better than the real thing
it ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! , we ’ re glad that you ’ re here  Would you like a tour of the house ?
that would be lovely   thanks , do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
well   I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table   but I don ’ t really care for curtains  Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient , my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift
I see  Well   I can help with the chores while I ’ m here  You two could probably use my help , that ’ s very nice of you to offer  Here ’ s your tea  Be careful   it ’ s still quite hot
how much are you looking to spend ? , I can only afford about 300 pounds a month
well   if you want to live in London   you have to pay the price ! , do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ?
how long do you want to sign a contract for ? , I can sign a contract up to a year  I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that
you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent   right ? , no   I thought that would be included in the rent
don ’ t worry  Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children , that's a good idea  I ’ ll look into finding something like that
oh   that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count ! , ok   ok   how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled  Listen   I'm still pretty new around here   would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
You mean the large one or the small one ? , The large one
No  We have some that are different in style but not in color  They're over there  Do you see the sign ? , Oh   yes  I think I'll look at those over there before I decide
I'm really sorry   Ethan  I tried so hard   but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town  The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here , what ? I don't understand
Huh ? What were you talking about   then ? , ' going Dutch ' means to split the bill   silly !
Don't feel like it  I'm broke , Well   we can still do some window shopping   can't we ?
How can I get to Lakeside Park ? , Take the No  7 bus  There's a bus stop just over there
Hello  Excuse me  Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? , Yes   go straight along Beijing Road and turn right
Thanks very much , You're welcome
buying a house can be expensive   but there are ways to find cheaper houses , like what ?
sure   my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way  They ’ re pretty satisfied with it , is the house pretty run-down
it was about 75 years old  There were a few repairs that needed doing   but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time , is it in a good location ?
you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world , I know  But we could get some exercise in   and we could get some errands run   too  Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything
I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight , fine   we ’ ll do that on the way home   so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time
ok   let ’ s go then ! , do you have any money ?
you said you were only going to window shop ! , I agreed to not go into the mall   but I can still look at things in the market !
oh   Iris ! what was it about this time ? , it was over food  I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no
I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth , But   Boris   i am not a baby any more
she also believes in healthy diet  And she requires us to have regular meals , poor you  It seems we are in the same boat
not really  I may have some occasionally for a chance  But I don't indulge myself too much , how do you manage it ?
how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym , that's a good idea  I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family
I agree  They're very lovely   especially " Huan Huan " , is that the red one ? That is my favorite   too  Do you know how much they are ?
I don't think so  All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now , any other ideas ?
good afternoon ! Can I help you ? , could you show me where the Chinese-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat
of course  The fitting room is right over there , do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight
oh   that suits you very well  Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck , really ? I'll take it   and I'm leaving here tomorrow  Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ?
let me see , Boris   look at this sentence  " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies   staying unrealistically thin   or depriving yourself of foods you love  " It's interesting   isn't it ?
Probably   Iris  That must be the job of nutritionists , Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves  So we are free to have whatever foods we love  It is unbelievable
Yes   I felt exactly the same way as you did just now  Scientists must be crazy in saying so , Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet
I'm so hungry  Shall we go eat now   Rick ? , sure  Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ?
well   what do you have in mind ? , how about the Mongolian hot pot ?
sounds great  Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well , yes  The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines
wow   the duck looks so delicious  Should we order it   Rick ? , the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces  There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each
incredible  By the way   what are these in the plates ? , oh   they are pancakes   hollowed sesame buns   scallions   cucumbers and oisin sauce  I will show you how to make one
oh   it's terrific  I love the floor  Can you tell me how it was prepared ? , certainly  First   a Beijing duck is specially selected  After it is cleaned and dressed   it will be roasted in an open oven  Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique
What's wrong   officer ? , You do realize that you ran a red light   don't you ?
I'm sorry for running it   but I really didn't know , Didn't you learn that red means stop ?
I'm not sure , I'm giving you a ticket for this
I would like to make an offer on this house   but I don ’ t know much about the process , As your realtor   I am here to take care of this process  How much were you planning on offering ?
That sounds good   but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me , The market is fairly down right now   so the offer is a realistic one
Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime ? , You are already pre-qualified for your loan   so you are in good shape
Are you buckled up ? , All right  Now what do I do ?
Take a left , How far do you want me to go ?
We're back now   so why don't you try parking ? , Well   that was fun  Let's do it again soon
I need you to teach me how to drive , Yes   but do you have your learner's permit ?
I drove a car before   but only once , Are you aware of all the controls in the car ?
When do you have time ? , Call me tomorrow   and we'll get started
Yes   I remembered to bring my ticket with me today , Did you bring your ID ?
What do you need my ID for ? , We have to know that this ticket is really yours
Will everything be cleared from my record ? , Yes   everything will be cleared
It's getting late   and you have to wake up early tomorrow , There is no way that I can fall asleep right now
I really don't care   just go to sleep , What if I stay up and do something   until I get tired ?
You need to go to sleep now   so go to sleep , Good night
Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ? , Of course not  I really did lose track of time
It doesn't matter   you should have called and let me know , That's true  My bad for not calling
Exactly   maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules , Well   if I'm not living here anymore   then I won't have to listen to your rules
The wine list is on the second page of your menu , Do you have mixed drinks in this restaurant ?
Actually   we are famous for our Cuervo Gold margaritas , That sounds good ! Please bring me one of those
Would you like it with salt or no salt ? , I would like my margarita with no salt   thank you

Whole Foods is way better than Sons   trust me , I'll take your word for it
What foods do you eat now ? , I tend to stick to fruits   vegetables   and chicken
Why aren't you eating anything else ? , Well   fruits and vegetables are very healthy
I guess that does sound a lot healthier , I really need to start eating healthier
I try my best to eat only fruits   vegetables   and chicken , Is that really all that you eat ?

You're supposed to drink water when you're dehydrated , I would like some water

It's really only a small load , Do you mind washing my clothes ?
It's no trouble at all , Did you already wash your clothes today ?

You're welcome , What does it cost to ride this bus ?
I haven't been driving for long — only for a few months , Do you like to drive the bus ?

I started driving the bus a few months ago , Is it fun driving the bus ?
I never did either   but it pays the bills , I enjoyed talking to you
You're going to have to make an appointment , Can I make one right now ?
The only time we can come on Friday is at 3 , I'm going to need it installed earlier than that
Saturday is perfect  What time would you like ? , Is 11
What kind would you like ? , What kind of internet is there ?
I would recommend DEL , So that one better ?
DEL isn't connected through your phone line   but dial-up is , So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet ?
I've finished my white clothes  I need to wash the rest , Well   when you do your darks   can you wash some of mine too ?
Do you have a lot of clothes that need to be washed ? , There aren't many clothes   is your load big ?

I'll make it to school on time  Don't worry , Okay   I'll let you sleep for a little while longer
Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get ? , What are my options ?
DEL is the best choice , Why is DEL better ?
Well   with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line , That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time   right ?
Give me five more minutes  I'm really tired this morning , I'm sorry   but it's time for you to get ready for school
Believe me  I will get up and get ready in five minutes , There's a lot that you need to do this morning
I'm going to be on time today , Go back to sleep then   but only five more minutes
Which kind of internet connection do you want to get ? , What kind can I get ?
I would get DEL if I were you , DEL is better than dial-up ?
Dial-up is connected through your phone   unlike DEL , That'll make it impossible for me to use
I'm so tired  Let me sleep for five more minutes , You have to get up and get ready for school
I promise I'll wake up   in five minutes , You still need to eat breakfast   take a shower   and get dressed
I'm not going to be late today , Fine   five more minutes
I'm not ready to go to sleep  I'm not tired , It's quite late   and you have an early day tomorrow
I've tried that before  It really doesn't work , That's beside the point   you still need to go to bed
I promise I'll go to sleep soon , No   you're going to sleep now   so good night
I can't sleep  I'm really not all that tired , You need to get some rest   as you have to get up early in the morning
That really does not work for me , It doesn't matter   you need to get some sleep
Don't worry   I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while , I want you in bed   right now   so sweet dreams
I really didn't mean to , It doesn't matter   because you damaged my car
What's wrong with it ? , My bumper is smashed in
If you'd just give me your number and insurance   then I'll handle it , Here  I'd better get a call from you
That was my fault  I'm sorry , You messed up my car
I don't see anything wrong with it , It's smashed in
I'll take care of everything  I just need your phone number and insurance , I need your information too
You don't know what happened ? , What did happen ?
I wouldn't lie about something like that , Were there any injuries ?
The news said they should be fine , I'm glad to know that everyone made it out okay
Nobody told you what happened ? , Tell me the news
I am completely serious , Did anyone get hurt ?
I believe so , That's great to hear
You haven't heard about it ? , No   don't you know what happened ?
I'm telling you the truth , Did anyone get hurt ?
I think so , Well   that's a miracle that no one was killed
Did you notice that stop sign you ran through ? , I'm sorry   I didn't even notice it
That's true  Those bushes are a problem , I swear that I didn't mean to run it
Under the circumstances   I think I'm just going to let you go with a warning , Thanks a lot
I stopped you for driving through a red light , Did I really ?

I'll let you off with a warning , Thank you   I really do appreciate that
There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for , I really didn't see it
Those bushes are covering the stop sign , I really didn't mean to run it
No   I'm just going to let you go , Thanks for being so understanding
Are you aware that you drove through a red light ? , I ran a red light ?
Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down   not speed up ? , I did learn that
I'm going to have to write you a ticket , I understand
Tell me what the problem is , I can't figure out how to turn them on
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar , Where do I put the change ?
That's all there is , I appreciate you helping me with this
What do you need help with ? , Do you know how to turn them on ?
You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer , So what do I need to do ?
That's everything , Thanks for all your help
I started washing here about three years ago , How come ?
What reason are you washing here today ? , I can't wash at home because my machine is broken
Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while ? , I have no choice
I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago , Why is that ?
Why are you washing your clothes here now ? , My washing machine broke down
So you're just going to wash here ? , Yeah   I think that's what I'm going to have to do
I have been coming here for the past few years , Why do you wash here ?
Why don't you wash clothes at home ? , I would   if my washing machine wasn't broken
So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ? , That's my only option right now
No   not yet , Well   when were you planning on doing that ?
I'm going to clean it , I want you to vacuum in your room   and don't forget to dust everything
I'm not going anywhere until later   so I'll clean it then , Have you begun cleaning up that room of yours ?
I'm planning on cleaning it up a little later , I told you to clean it up earlier
I won't forget , I don't want you to leave until you clean up
I haven't gotten started on my room yet , When exactly do you plan on cleaning it ?
I already told you that I'm going to do it , Remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything
I'll clean my room before I leave , I want to get some cable
We have movie channel packages , What else have you got ?
We have that package , Let me get that package

We have all kinds of movie channel packages , What else do you have ?
Yes   we do offer that package , I want that
You can always get rid of channels or add some later , May I order some cable from you today ?
We offer packages with all the movie channels , Are there any other packages ?
We have that available , I would like to get that
Yes   you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like , Something's wrong with my computer
Did you see if all the connections are right ? , I'm not sure I understand what you mean
If your plugs aren't connected all the way   the computer won't turn on , I had no idea
Let me know if that doesn't work , I need to get my internet fixed
How long has this been happening ? , This problem has been happening for a few days now
There's obviously a problem with your connection , I'm going to need someone to come and fix it for me
They'll be there in about an hour , I'm having problems with my computer
Have you checked the connections on your computer ? , What connections ?
It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected , I didn't think of that
It should work   but let me know if it doesn't , I need somebody to come over and fix my internet
How long have you been having this problem ? , It hasn't been working the past few days
Well   the internet isn't down   so there must be something wrong with your connection , Could you send someone to fix it today ?
They should be there in the next hour , I need to get my high speed internet installed
What day would you like us to do the installation ? , Is Friday good ?
I'm sorry  That's the only available time , Are you available this Saturday ?
We can do it  See you then , Can you send someone to fix my internet ?
Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up ? , I've been having this problem for the last few days
Since the internet isn't broken   your connection must be messed up , Do you think you can send somebody over to fix it ?
It should be no longer than an hour , My computer isn't working
Try checking the connections , Which ones are you referring to ?
If they're not connected right   that will keep it from turning on , I did not know that
Tell me if it's still not working , We finally get a chance to meet
I need to speak with you about your daughter , Is there something wrong ?
She is a great addition to my class , You don't have anything bad to say about her ?
I'm more than happy having her in my class , Hello   it's nice to meet you
I would like to talk to you about your daughter , Is there a problem ?
Your daughter is a wonderful student , She isn't messing up in class ?
It is my pleasure to have her in my class , Hi   how are you ?
I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter , Is she acting up in class ?
She is absolutely wonderful , So she isn't causing you any problems ?
You have nothing to worry about with her , Hello   I'm returning your phone call
I needed to talk to you about your son , Is he messing up in school ?
He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class , I don't know what's gotten into him
I really appreciate your help , I have never done this before and don ’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house
It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer  How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ? , I hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer
It usually doesn ’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer , Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready ?
Thank you for returning my call , What was your call about ?
He was messing around last week in class , Exactly what did he do ?
I need you to talk to him   if you don't mind , That won't happen again   I'm sorry
The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars , Should I accept their offer ?
No one else has made an offer   so you could make another offer if you want to do so , I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer
By now   the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept  It will go quickly , I believe that you called me ?
I was calling about your son , Did he do something wrong ?
He was talking and causing a disturbance during class , That's really not like him
Don't worry about it   but thank you very much , Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ?
You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer , If I make another offer and they refuse   then what ?
I will contact the sellers with your current offer , Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ?
I didn't mean to  It was an accident , You have completely damaged my car
What did I do to it ? , You smashed my bumper in with your car
Look   just give me your insurance and number and I'll take care of it , Give me your information   in case I don't hear from you
I was able to contact them so   if you ’ ll step into my office   we ’ ll talk , Did they go with the proposed counter-offer ?
It can cost between five hundred and one thousand dollars , Do I get to choose who inspects the home ?
I am going to contact the sellers immediately  They were looking forward to your acceptance , I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front
They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses  Let ’ s see what the inside looks like , I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here
I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it , Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?
I needed to ask you a question , Ask away
I want to get my license , You have to do six hours behind the wheel
Is that all ? , There's nothing else to it
I need to take a few classes , What kind of classes would you like to take ?
I don't understand why I need to make an appointment , You need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork
I'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9 , That'll be fine

OK   let ’ s go check out the kitchen next , Oh look   they have some refreshments in here
Yes   it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand , From the looks of this house from the outside   I don ’ t really think that I want to go inside
Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint , With so few windows   how can you even see what the problems are ?
The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite  I think that we should go look at it since we are here , Is there a dead animal somewhere in here ?

It can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand dollars , Is it my choice as to who inspects this house ?

I'm so nervous about this oral test , Just calm down  I'm sure you'll do well
My dissertation  I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now , Did you finish typing it yesterday ?

Our place is spotlessly clean   compared with others , Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ?
I bet nobody will care about it , Richard   why didn't you come to school today ?
I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book , Yeah  It's boring  I'd rather read something more exciting
I can't work out this problem , Let me take a look  Maybe I can figure it out
Stop it  Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else , You can't prove that by me  I saw the score on your report
You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did  Admit it , I worked hard too  But she always gives me a lower grade
Yes   it is  Are you looking for housing for this semester ? , I was hoping to get into something on campus   but my friend told me that everything is full
Yes   here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As , Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them ?
Yes   I've been thinking about visiting you  I hope to get some advice from you , Which country do you want to go to ?
Which university should I apply to ? , There are many universities for you to choose from  Some famous universities such as Harvard   Yale   the University of Michigan   and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study   but they are very competitive and expensive  Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper
More than one  I think the count is now three   if I remember correctly , Wow  I'm getting rushed too   but just one  Are you thinking of joining any of them ?
I think I'm going to decline  I just prefer to do my own thing , Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ?
I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant  But so far   I only have fifteen , What's the matter   are the classes you want full ?
I think with International Business a language would be appropriate , Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ?
It's ok  What do you want to ask ? , Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers , What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
Yes   a lot more  If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester   you can get your student ID and social security number there  They will keep your documents up-to-date  They will offer an orientation program for new comers  They will also help you contact your department and registration office , I see  It must be worth going to
It sure is  They also serve tea   coffee and refreshments  The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful  Everyone loves them , What are you going to do for one year abroad   Tom ?
Yes  I am going to take some university courses there , Sounds hard
Hey   I am a pretty cool guy  I will make friends   and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too  You know   like fencing   or theater or something , What do you think of your teacher ?

Yes   just over there to your right , Thank you very much
My name is Jung Min  What's your name ? , My name is Jessica  It's nice to meet you
Yeah  It's pretty exciting to be here , Have fun while it lasts  The excitement wears off real quick  Especially after you see how much homework you get  Where are you from ?
Why were you in Japan ? , My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country  He's so into learning about different cultures
Well   if you ever want to visit Korea   I would be happy to show you around , Thanks for the offer  I'll keep that in mind  Oh   the professor is coming  We'll talk more after class
I register this Friday , What classes do you plan on taking ?
Yeah  I tried to get in last semester   but it was full by the time I registered , What other classes are you going to take ?
Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from , I had Professor Mahoney
Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? , Not at all  I got a 38
Well   I can't compare to you  I got a 31 in English 101  That means if you got a lower grade in English 201   it must be harder , It's not what it appears  I actually tried harder in the 101 class  If I put as much effort into the 201 class   I would have received the same grade
Yeah  My whole GPA is screwed up now , Why ? What happened ?
Well   it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have , Why don't you re-take the class next year ?
My GPA is pretty similar to yours  I have a 31 now because of the stupid econ class , What was your GPA before this semester ?
Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class , What happened to you ?
You're right  I'm not going to play games during school anymore , Hi Mark
I worked over the summer at a restaurant  Have to make tuition money   right ? What did you do ? , I took summer school  I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up
That makes sense  So where is Nicole ? , She dropped out of school completely
Wow  She's so lucky  She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job , It sounds good now   but I'm traditional  I want the degree   so I wouldn't have accepted the offer
Hey Mike  I forgot about registration  I'm a day late   so all the classes are mostly full  What do you think I should do ? , You're screwed  You can't do anything about that  You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful
Did you register yet ? , Of course  Registering for classes is not something you want to miss
That's helpful  Thanks  But what do you think about philosophy  I wanted to take that class this semester , I took that class last year  The professor is really cool   so if you go to his office   you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full
That makes sense  I think I'll do that  Thanks for all the help , No problem   man
I take it tomorrow morning  There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on  What types of questions did you get ? , Mostly on the civil war  You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr  had on American society
Hopefully he will use the same exam   cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war  It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class , If you cant study everything   then that is probably the best way to go
Thanks  See ya , Can I help you ?
Can I check this one out ? , I ’ m sorry  It ’ s for reference only   so it must stay in the library  But you ’ re welcome to look through it
Thanks for your help , Hi Kevin   how was your year at college ?
Yes   I'm dating someone  Her name is Amanda , Good morning   John  Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ?
I'm feeling better today , How many days do you plan to finish reading it ?
No problem , You'd better prepare for the examination
Maybe you're right  I have been too lazy lately , Han Maimed   What's your plan for the weekend ?
Oh   my God ! John   I didn ’ t know you are religious  You just look like a scientific kook   like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory , Come on   Han Maimed   don ’ t make a fuss  A lot of Americans   including many scientists   believe in religion
I've heard about it a little bit before   but I don ’ t understand  How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? , That ’ s a little complicated  You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U  S  history later on  Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life  Guess what ? Even Harvard University   which is a highly academic institution   is in a sense the product of religion
Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? , Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans
So   you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? , Yes   that's why Puritans moved to the New World   where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans  Later on   it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College
Oh   I see , Actually Harvard was first named ' New College '   without a formal name
It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion , Therefore   it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion   there would note Harvard
I finally begin to get to know Harvard  It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor  I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard , Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States  So you have to know the U  S  history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard  The two are closely related
Hey Jack  How were your classes this semester ? , They were not too bad  I really liked my poli-sci class
What class was your favorite then ? , I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific
Yeah  Last semester , Who was the professor ?
He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot   but fortunately   he's an easy grader , What did you end up getting ?
Are you enjoying the class so far ? , I hate it and I was about to withdrawal  But after hearing your experience   I think I will tough it out
Hi Jackie  You don't look too well  What's going on ? , It's nothing  I'm just a little stressed out
The best thing to do is study as much as you can  I'm sure you'll do alright , I hope so  I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days  That's what it'll take
Hi ! Dick  Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry , Playground  We're having sports for today's outside class activities  All my classmates have already got there
Enjoy yourself , It's weekend again   I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters
You've been always active and versatile  It seems that you are interested in everything , Oh   really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert   painting   handwriting   reading novels and reading fashion magazines  What about yours ?
That's a good suggestion  It's fine today  Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset  It must be fantastic , I quite agree with you  With our hobbies   our life can be more colorful and exciting
David   what do you want to do after graduation ? , I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List '   to be a public officer   what do you think ?
You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor   and then make a decision , It's a sunny day   isn't it ?
Are you American ? , No   I'm a Britisher  Where do you come from ?
Me   too , Great  Maybe we can study and play games together  I think we can be good friends
Sure  What do you want to know ? , Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ?
It can be completed in four years normally , I see  Thank you very much
Oh   I know  When is it ? , December 1st
Well  I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam , Why are you so pessimistic ?
Thank you  That's very nice of you , Good morning   madam  I'd like to apply for a library card  Can you help me ?
Then you have to give me 15 dollars for the deposit  The library card is free , OK  Here is the money  And If I return the card   can I get the refund ?
You are welcome , Peter   which club do you want to join ?
But I don't know how to play basketball , It's OK  Don't worry about it  Our school coach will train us to play basketball
The teacher just canceled the test , Are you kidding ?
Yes  Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? , Welcome to our school  If you need any help   please come to me
Serves you right , Peter   have you finished your English composition ?
I know  I know ! , Do you think you can finish it on time ?
Well   it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me , Sorry !
Just imagine   if a horse can fly   if a bird can swim  and things like that , I see  But could you give me another piece of paper ?
Good morning   Miss Li , Morning   Mike
I feel much better now , Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ?
I will , Would you like to come to our party ?
It's the end of the world for me , What makes you say that ?

It's my geography   sirThe Map of Africa you set us , But this should have been handed in last Thursday
My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home , Oh   Yes ?
Yes  You've done a good job  But there's one thing  You should narrow down your topic , What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
Good morning ! Can you help me   please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother , Well   what kind of books does she like ?
Oh   yes ! , Do you know if she's read this one ?
She's eighty-seven , I suggest you take this book  It's very exciting
I hope so  I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing   and I'm not quite sure where to look , I'll certainly try to help you  What topic is your paper on ?
Thank you for you help , Excuse me   can you tell me the name of the book you read ?
Actually   the language itself is not so funny   but you can imagine the scene   that's funny , Got it
It's really a good book  You will like it too , I'll try to read it  Actually   I like literature very much
Me too  Pride and Prejudice is my favorite , I like it too  But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite
I know  But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time  No more than one third of her students will go to her class , I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well  Most students either sleep or do other things in her class
Right   so we must spare some time to attend selective courses , But isn't it too impolite to be absent ?
Sometimes I will try various excuses  But this is my last time asking for leave  Or I will have a bad record , Yeah   besides   your credit will be deducted  That is kind of serious
I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government  But before that   I must do my job  Bye  Don't forget about that note , You can count on me
Can I help you ? , Yes  I'd like to borrow these books
Here you are  You must return them within a month , What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ?

All right  But I am very poor at math  Would you like to help me with my math ? , No problem
Yes   I'd like to know how to use the library  You know   I'm a new student here , All you need is your student identification card to check out books
Thank you very much  By the way   how many books am I allowed to check out ? , You can check out two books at a time  But you can't check out newspapers   magazines and periodicals   they have to be read within library
I want a book on physics  Could you show me where I can find it ? , Yes   over there to your left
I'm a graduate student here in mathematics  I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before  I'll be here for five years   so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible  I wonder if someone might have time to show me around , I'd be very glad to show you around   but I'm very busy right now  Could you come back about 3 thirty ?
Thank you  Good-bye , Would you like to go skating with me this afternoon ?
In fact   our dormitory is much worse than they can be described , It's hard for me to imagine  How can you stand that ?
Yes   we do  That's why we have a cleaning every three months , Three months ? Incredible !
Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week , Only for this reason ?
Oh   thank you  That's very nice of you , How do I apply to an American university ?
That is true  I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities  First of all   you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work   three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence   and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 )  Then you need a financial guarantee   and an application fee of 25 dollars , What's to come next ?
From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well , Thank you  I appreciate your help

The job market is so competitive nowadays  I want to develop some useful skills , I really admire you for that  How is it going ?
Study study study ! I want to learn a lot , You ’ re going to take courses ?
Yes   but I think it ’ s probably for the best , Won ’ t you get lonely ?
Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? , I ’ m not sure  What ’ s the difference between them ?
One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other  It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers , I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools
Sorry   I can't  I am busy , What are you doing ?
I help out at the children's hospital  I help plan activities , Oh   yeah ?
I know ! I hate it ! But I ’ m taking this crash course in math , Why ?

But I'm a new student here  I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class  I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office , Well   I could put you on a waiting listBut that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class  What is your name ?
I'm a comparative literature major , Wait a minute  You're a Comp Lit major ?
That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287  I know it's a required classAnd Professor Cohen told me I need to take it , The university computer system saves extra places   in class 287 for comp lit students  I can give you a special codeWhen you register by phone   you can use the code to get into the class
Oh   I didn't know that , Sure  Here is the code number   with information on how to use it
Thanks , Next time you come in here   I will recognize you
Good  I think it's a good idea  Our department should require meetings like this , I want to finish my degree in four yearsSo I don't want to forget to take classes I need  I have a friend who has to stay in college another yearShe didn't know until recently  There were some classes she needed to take to graduateShe didn't know about them
Alright  Good  I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirementsYou have one botany class and one chemistry class  And political scienceSo that's nine credits  Did you take English Composition 201 ? , No   I don't need to  I took Advanced Placement English in high schoolSo I'm not required to take composition
Actually   I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later , Well   I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class  I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets
Good  I recommend it  Shakespeare is of course enormously importantWe want our students to take the class as soon as they canAnd Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher , I'll take it then
Really ? That's great to know , That's the reason I want to finish my B  A  in four yearsBecause I know I will be in school a long time  I want to start the M  A  and Ph  D  program as soon as possible
Alright  Do you have a coin ? , Yes  Here's a quarter  I flip it   you call it in the air
Oh   well  So you get the bottom bunk  What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos  Probably we only have room for one , Your stereo is better than mine  Do you mind if we use yours ?
Alright  That's a good plan  What about the desks ? We have two desks   one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? , Well   the desk by the window is nicer   of course  Don't you think ?
Alright , I mean   we could flip a coin for it   but I would probably win again  I'm incredibly lucky you know  Especially with girls
Well   I hope you let me hang out with you then  Maybe I can learn from you , Oh   certainly  Certainly  I'm always willing to help beginnersJust call me Big Brother Dave
Anyway   I get the desk by the window   you get the bottom bunk  That's it , Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ?
How can I help you today   Alice ? , Well   I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship
What kind of scholarship is it ? , It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association  I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American
Excellent  So you'll have a good chance of getting it , Well   I hope so  The competition is probably pretty heavyAnd they want a writing sample too
What is the question ? , They give applicants a topicThe topic is   The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic SocietyMy essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced
Good luck  I'm sure you will do a good job , I came here today to talk to you because  Well   I need to ask two favors
I'd be happy to write one for you , And second  Well   I'm not sure if it's normal
Of course I could read it  That's no problem  But you need to get it to me soon , I will  I want to write the first draft tonightSo I could bring it tomorrow morning
Don't mention it  I'm always willing to help good students , Can I help you ?

Are you Chinese ? , Yes   I am  I am from Taiwan  I came here to study political science
I want to study Mandarin and international relations , Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ?
You just said your English needs work   yes ? , Yes   that's true  Especially my writing  I think my papers aren't good enough  I make too many grammatical mistakes
Yes   why not ? I mean   if you come to this cafe often   maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English , That sounds like a good idea  How often would you like to do it ?
First   we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writingIf you want   I could help you edit your papersOr we could do English conversation  Whatever you wantAnd then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese , Would I help you with writing ?

But Laurie   how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? , What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough
Yes   but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember , I suppose you're right  But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down
Don't feel that way  I know you are very smartNote - taking is a special skill  All students need to learn itSome people are very smart   but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet  I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high schoolShe taught me how to take good notes  It's not hard , Alright  University and high school seem very different to me  I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes  Then I will do better
Well   you know how I am about exams  I'm a perfectionist , Don't worry about it  All in all   you've done very well in school
Are you a professor ? , What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old !

Which is better ? , One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other  It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers
It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies , Yes   I've been thinking about visiting you  I hope to get some advice from you

Not much  I'm still living at home and commuting to school  I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about  It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped  The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count , That sounds smart  but kind of boring
Definitely pre-med  What about you ? , I still have no clue  but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year   so I've got time ! Oops   I'm late for class  Gotta run !
I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time , What happened ?

Wow   you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay   here you go  You are registered now   you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start , How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events
If we do   too many people might attend  Perhaps we should invited all of them   but make a small charge to attend , Good idea  We should also hold a series of presentations  We could have presentations on the history of the university   the courses we offer   and our links with other universities
I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know   T-shirts   mugs   plates   pens   and things like that , That ’ s an excellent idea  Hopefully   we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university
I ’ m sure that will be very popular  OK   let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice , Hey Eve   how are you ?
Do you have a lot of homework ? , Yes  Don ’ t you ?
I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow , Are you in Mrs Green ’ s class ?
Do you want to study together ? , Sure  This library is too quiet though
Ok  Let ’ s go ! , Do you speak only English in the class   or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?

Sometimes it's difficult  Some words look different from the way one pronounces them , Hi   my name is Lean   and I'm from Russia
A second language is always difficult , True   but English is harder than most  It's a crazy language
No wonder you say English is a crazy language , Lucy   you ’ re back  How was your first day of school ?
Well   I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock   art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock   and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock , What do you think about the teachers ?
She was great  In today ’ s class   she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student  She told us not to arm for exams   and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing , Where is she from ?
Not everything   but nearly  She speaks very clearly and doesn ’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her , She sounds like a good teacher  Do you think you ’ ll pass her class ?
It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today  It means that I will not only pass the class   but I will do extremely well ! , If you like the class this much already   I ’ m sure you will
not today  She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework , no wonder you like the class so much
What was she like ? , She was patient   kind   fun   smart   caring   and yet strict   too  I really learned a lot from her
Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? , If you really want to do something and you work hard at it   I believe you can do it
I see  She sounds like she really cared about her students , Yes  She treated us all fairly  She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets
Do you know what she is doing now ? , As a matter of fact   I do  After she taught our class   she got married and moved to another city  Then   she started writing children ’ s book
Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? , ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time
I hope so  You see   at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent  I'm awfully worried   I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect , Oh   she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class  She doesn't mind your making mistakes   though
That's the new teacher , What do you think of the teacher ?
English   of course , Is she your teacher ?
Not very much , It's a good thing you can speak English !
You sound relieved , Well   yes  I don't mind admitting that I am  I enjoyed school   but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams
You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? , Oh   yes
Actually   five and a half  On Saturday   we have classes only in the morning , Gosh !

Hi   Walter ! , Hi   Sterling !
You're got a point thereBut do you think he's a little absent-minded ? , I guess so
Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ? , Most public schools in the United States are very good   and the majority of students attend the public schools

Are there many idioms in English ? , There are hundreds and hundreds  English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions
What about the expression " goodbye " ? Is that an idiom ? , That is just a natural   grammatical English expression  It has a direct translation in other languages
Because Myra was cheating on examsand she spoke back rudely , I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher  I know she was angry   but that's still no excuse for rudeness

What courses are you going to take next year ? , Well   I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics   but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet  I'd like to take English

What am I to do ? , You can always take it again
Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? , Yes   uh  I put it in the front of my sociology notebook  Oh   here it is
You see   your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter  If one student removes the book from the library   it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it  So   your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve , So   will I be able to find this book ?
Will there be anything else ? , No ! I am on my way to the reserve room  Thanks again !
I'll certainly try to help youWhat topic is your paper on ? , My paper is on the influence of television on children

I think so too  I don't like him either  Well   who do you like best ? , It might be the English teacher  What about you ?
Yeah   I like her way of teaching  She told us not to cram for exams   and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing , I think it's a good way to develop our language ability
What's the matter ? Are you OK ? , I don't know where to go for college   and what to major in
You always worry too much about everything  Take it easy   honey  You are good enough  You can go to the ideal college , OK   OK  I'm so sorry  By the way   for you   is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ?
That's only a joke  To be honest   I have to improve my English   because my English is not good enough  I still get confused about some simple grammars  Since you are quite good at it   do you have any suggestions ? , En   first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class  Second   I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center

Oh   I am so tired  My back is sore and my neck hurts , That's normal  You have been sitting for three hours   with your attention highly concentrated
One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year  He filled the school column with his name   and his score was relinquished , How could he make such a silly mistake ?
Yeah  The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam  Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam  And there are fewer subjects , That's a very good lesson  We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on
Yes   I am applying on it , I wonder if I could enroll in it  I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior   but
Well   if you think you are ready   I'll let you enroll , Oh   thanks   professor Donaldthis is very nice of you
Can you give us an example ? , I'll look up the rateTo look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roofIt means to search for and find some information
This is interesting   MsParker , Let's program your courses   since you have had English literature   you should take American literature and American prose and fictionYou transcript indicate that your english background is strong   so I don't think you have any problem with it
Thank you   sir   I'm sure I will , Are you studying any languages here ?
I'm majoring in English , Is it difficult to learn ?
I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries  I like the culture , RightIt ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well
Study English , You mean you like to study English ? Why ?
I don't mind the work  I think it's worthwhile , Margaret   do you think I should enroll in the science course ?
Well   I have to take biology   chemistry   maps and physicswhat you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors , Yes   I really weak in maps   I did poorly in high school
Oh   we never speak Spanish in class ! MissParker speaks to us only in English , I suppose she's rightDoes she speak English very slowly ?
Mario and I are the best students in the classMissParker says that my pronunciation is very good , Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
You can't help learning when you're using it all dayYou ' ll see  A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you , I hope soYou see   at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent  I'm awfully worried   I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect
Who's that over here ? , That's the new teacher
What does she teach ? , English   of course
Can she speak Chinese to her students ? , Not very much
He's very strict with us , And I hear he gives very good lectures
To study  I am going to the University of Tampa to do a postgraduate course for three years , And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ?
I've got a letter from my bank here  It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies , Could I see that   please ?
Oh   but mine is a three-year program , Yes   it is a three-year   but you can renew the visa each year in the States  It is our usual procedure
On the contrary   I think he's very serious , No   not at all  His examples are really interesting
He's an old antique   very serious , Bad luck   Anne
I'm sorry to hear that , Hi   Walter !
Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist , You're got a point there  But do you think he's a little absent-minded ?
You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants   and if she saw Myra cheating   she certainly had the right to say so , I agree she had the right to say something   but I feel she should have done it privately
Because Myra was cheating on exams   and she spoke back rudely , I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher  I know she was angry   but that's still no excuse for rudeness
You should hand it in before next Sunday , Oh   I know  I will try my best
Yeah   I've been looking forward to it for ages , What do your classmates think of it ?
Oh   maybe three years  I will study and get the master degree first  Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back , Which university will you go to ?
Thank you ! , Have you been in America long   Hellen ?
I am going to register at Harvard next month , What are you going to major in ?

I major in Japanese , What do you think of the literature course ?
Professor Donald   are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? , Yes   I am applying on it
I know   but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field , Well   if you think you are ready   I'll let you enroll
Well   I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics   but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet  I ’ d like to take English , Why are you going to take English with chemistry and physics ?
I am going to be a   well   I hope to be a research chemist , Let's program your courses  Since you have had English literature   you should take American literature and American prose and fictionYou transcript indicate that your English background is strong   so I don't think you have any problem with it
Thank you   sir   I'm sure I will , Marquet   do you think I should enroll in the science course ?
Well   I have to take biology   chemistry   maps and physics  What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors , Yes   I'm really weak in maps   I did poorly in high school
Just call her Lisa   Mary  She's cooking dinner , I see  Can I sit down ?
Please   just call me Tom , Okay   Tom
Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner , Before we begin eating   I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan
It's huge ! , Yeah  They're usually this big
Thank you so much , Don't mention it
This is usually my chore , I don't mind helping
That's right  Mom didn't know where to buy chopsticks for you , Don't be silly ! I know how to use knives and forks
I agree she had the right to say something   but I feel she should have done it privately , You're rightIf I were the teacher   I wouldn't have done that
No   not at allHis examples are really interesting , So they're easy to remember
Bad luck   Anne , Hey ! How about your history teacher ?
Don't talk too much   Tom  We are on duty today   we should hurry up , OK
I'm going to sweep the floor first , Daniel   I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard
How about the podium ? , Oh   I forgot about it  I'll get it
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester  I have more homework to do now , What's your favorite course   Daniel ?
Surprise ? , I thought you would like PE
Through this course   I can learn more about the world around us clearly , Your parents would be happy if they knew that  Because you are always a naughty boy
Daniel   would you like to have a look at my dorm ? , Of course   I'd like to
It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks   but it is spacious and bright , Do you get along with your roommates ?
We are on the 5th floor   and there's a very nice view from the balcony , Oh   you can climb the stairs as a workout
Let's give them a hand , Daniel   I can't catch up with the English teacher very well
That's OK  But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools , English school ? What is that ?
Yes   before you start your training   they will test you on your English first , Adam   could you show me around the school ?
You mean the white building near the playground ? , Yes
You know   our school is divided into two parts   the junior high school and the senior high school  That is the new classroom building for our senior high school , Is there a swimming pool in your school ?
I believe that you can make your dream come true , Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ?
Our neighbor   Bruce   will take part in the relay race  Let's go have a look , OK   let's go
Other competitors have almost caught up with him  They are neck and neck , Come on   Bruce  Come on   Bruce
Sure   what's the author's name   please , I can't remember that clearly  It probably be Charles
OK   do you know the title of the book ? , Oh   sorry  I'm always absent-minded  I remember that I've put a note in my pocket
Oh   such bad luck   sir  Can you please name the category of the book ? , Let me see  It's not fiction  It's biography
Excuse me   could you tell me where you have got that music book ? , Certainly  Let me see  Oh   it's on that self
Thank you very much , Do you offer a course in business management ?
It's 3 nights a week   Monday   Tuesday and Thursday , And how long does the course last ?
The next beginning class starts on October 25th , What time is the class ?
It costs 125 dollars a month , Yes   that's all right  I want to enroll in the course
Yes   please  We need a record of you education and your work experiences , At what age do children start school in your country ?
Yes   they do , Do you think this is a good idea ?
Yes   they do , What examinations do they take first ?
Three or four years , Good morning   Miss
All you need is your student identification card to check out books , YesHere ' s my identification
You can check out two books at a time  But you can't check out newspapers   magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library , How long can I keep the books ?
Yes   over there to your left , Excuse me   Miss
I'd be very glad to show you around   but I'm very busy right nowCould you come back about 3 30 ? , Sure  3:30 this afternoon
Can I help you ? , Yes  I'd like to borrow these books
Here you are  You must return them within a month , What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ?
No trouble at all  So long , Who's that over here ?
She's very nice , What does she teach ?
YesShe teaches our class three times a week , Can she speak Chinese to her students ?
You're just left school   haven't you   Emily ? , Yes   I finished last Friday
Well   what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? , Yes   I intend to go to universityThat ' ll be in SeptemberBut it all depends on my A level results

That's too much for us really , Where are you going now ?
I'm going to register right now , That's good
No   not at allHis examples are really interesting , So they're easy to remember
Bad luck   Anne , Hey ! How about your history teacher ?
What do you think of your teacher ? , He's very strict with us
Excuse meWhere do I register ? , Oh   over there in Pacific Pavilion
Thanks , Hi   Lilly   it ’ s so nice to see you again
You know   I like traveling  I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself , What's the matter ? You don't look well
My exam , Oh   is that all ?
what do you hope to do when you finish university ? , I ’ d like to go into management  I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers  How about you ?
if life were easy   then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored , unfortunately   it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed
I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in   not something that other people force you to be interested it , my father wanted me to become a doctor   but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field
Good  Thanks for asking , What may I do for you ?
I am looking for a newspaper article , Have you looked in the periodicals ?
That would be a lot of help , Follow me   please
It is  It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world   with brief descriptions of how they were build   their purpose   and so on , There are the pyramids  It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though
Yes  Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape , TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top  They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical
It says here that it ’ s m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings , Is that building a perfect cube ?
What book is that ? , I just bought a new atlas  I ’ m looking this map of the world  Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country
Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia  European countries are relatively small  France looks quite big in Europe   but compared to many countries in other continents   it ’ s not very l , Britain is half the size of france   but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world
I want to check out these books , I need your library card
Are you sure ? , Yes   I ’ m sure
I don ’ t have that right now , You have to pay it off before you can check out more books
I need to check these books out , Do you have your library card ?
Really ? , Yes   really
I don ’ t have that much today , I ’ m sorry   but until you pay it   you won ’ t be able to check out any more books
I would like to check out a book , I ’ m going to need your library card
Sure  That would be great , Please fill out this application
Here you go , Here ’ s your library card
I need a passport , You can apply for one here
That would be great , I ’ m going to need you to complete this application
How long will it take ? , Your passport will be ready in a few weeks
Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile ? , I drive an automobile
Well   when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo   do not park there unless you have a special permit  Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ? , I park in the evenings
The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days  Do you know how to read the curb colors ? , Yes   I know what the curb colors mean
No problem   we have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done , I'm done
Well   this looks nice  Do you know how to use it ? , I am pretty sure how to use it   but can you remind me ?
Well   I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits ! , Professor   I will not be here for our next class meeting
Will you be able to make up the work you missed ? , I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading
Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ? , Sure   no problem
Is this something that you could schedule for another time ? , No   I have to do this ; it's important !
You know that I only allow one absence per semester   don't you ? , Yes   I know
Well   have a good day off from class , I would like to register for a class today
There are two classes that are still open , Which days are these classes on ?
The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12 , Are you sure there are no more open classes ?
Okay   I'll sign you up , Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is ?
That will be on the second of December  Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus  Do you understand ? , Yes   I understand
We will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 pmAny more questions , How much will the trip cost ?
What class are you trying to take ? , I want to take a Psychology class
One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p  m  to 4 , And the other class ?
Yes   I am sure , Okay   sign me up for the class on Monday and Wednesday
Do you know what class you want to take ? , Are there any Psychology classes available ?
There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 , Can you tell me about the other class ?
These two are the only ones , The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine
Uh   I don't know what to say  What do you want to know ? , What's your method of learning ?
Well   I talk to myself  That is   I play one role first   than the other , That's a good idea  You are really creative
I can't seem to find my class , What building is it in ?
Do you think you can tell me where it is ? , Sure   what room number is it ?
Could you show me where it is ? , No problem   come on
The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English , Oh   he wants to practice his language skills   too
That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ? , I don't know   but you know how to surround yourself with great friends !
Yes  But now I ’ Ve learned differently  Now I have a more realistic opinion , What do you think now ?
That ’ s true  But Americans work hard for their money like we do  I don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different , How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ?
I ’ m not kidding  Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time , So do we have to stay in this English class forever ?
You said it , How are you doing with your English Language studies ?
At first it was   but now I've got the basicsIt ' s fun , I have a real problem when I meet people
Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? , Oh yes  Men   women   and children shake hands all the time
Well   a good rule to follow is   for men you hold out your hand   for women and children   you wait and see what they do , That sounds easy enough
Well   they ’ re completely different  Reading is passive   and writing is active , I don ’ t think I understand what you mean  Could you explain a little more ?
A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge  Don ’ t you think so ? , I think I see what you mean  I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it
They ’ re both harder than reading or writing , In what way ?
I ’ m not trying to discourage you  I ’ m trying to help you  You have to live with these difficulties  Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face   the better you ’ ll do  I promise ! , I ’ Ve always wondered   what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ?
What do natives get ? , They get higher level English   which is more formal than everyday spoken English  They also deal with matters of style and creativity
I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities , Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think  That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes  Just talk to everyone every chance you get
What do you do in order to improve your English ? , I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things  Most importantly   I practice every chance I get
It takes a long time to learn a language   doesn ’ t it ? , It certainly does  But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress
So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? , Well   I think so  But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree  If can get a Ph  D  abroad   it will be much easy for me to get a job at home
It could be pretty tough studying abroad  Being so far away from home , Are you ok   Chuck ? You look pale
You did ? Do tell me  I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it   but I've made little progress ! , Sure  I'm learning Chinese through songs
That's a real achievement  How did you do that ? , I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer
Can Join you   Katherine ? I do want to have a try , Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day  We can learn it together now
Ok  I will bring it with me , How's your time spent in the United States ?
Well   the cultural differences impressed me most , You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ?
And what's more   when he told me he had caught a cold for several days   I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible , You really cared about your friend
I felt the same at first  Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick  Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor  But back in China   helping others is always regarded being kind , Absolutely  Now I understand why he responded that way
Well   I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! , Did you bow back ?
But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? , Things are different in Japan  You know   in some countries   making eye contact with others is considered rude
The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all  I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country , That's a good idea  When you don ’ t know much about other cultures   the simplest thing can offend someone
For more than five years , Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ?
Yeah   almost  But there is one thing , What ?
Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others , That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
I have felt that  One day when i was in a queue   reading a newspaper story   the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding , Well   that's not rare  I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus
Oh   I'm shocked , Pardon me  Could you please pass me the tissue ?
Yeah   I think the food is alright   it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me  But you are Chinese   you should have known better , Well   not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can  Back where I come from   people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies
I completely understand  I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either   but when you have no other choices   you've got to adapt , Yeah   I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome   do as the Romans do  '
Nice to meet you   LvanMy name is Alike  I'm from Japan , To me English is a difficult language
A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? , One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings
Oh   we never speak Spanish in class ! MissParker speaks to us only in English , I suppose she's right  Does she speak English very slowly ?
Mario and I are the best students in the class  Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good , Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
Yeah   Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate , Oh   no  I know how insensitive he can be  What has he done now ?
Yeah   but I get that sometimes  It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U  S    we'll always be foreigners in their eyes , What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
I told him 28 years  And   he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week  He was puzzled for a minute   and then he got it , Are you sure he really got the message ?
He said   ' 36 years   ' and we both laughed about it  He apologized and now   it's all good , I'm glad  I bet he won't make that mistake again
That ’ s the impression I get from the movies   and from looking around  Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other , Well   I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me
I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject  But go ahead , No   this will help answer your question  In American society boys and girls are raised together  They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age
Not exactly   but I see your point , I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office  After you ’ Ve been in America for a while   you will probably see what I mean
You mean you like to study English ? Why ? , It gives me great satisfaction
Hey   your Chinese is coming along ! , You think ?
Hang in there  It ’ ll all come together one of these days , Eric   how long will you be in China ?
Actually   I am learning that now  But it's too hard for me  You know the four tones and the stuff  It really freaks me out , Don't worry  All things are difficult before they are easy
What is it ? , It's where I teach you Chinese   and in exchange you teach me English
Ok   cool , Good  I'll give you a call tonight
Are you studying any languages here ? , Yes   I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department
Is it difficult to learn ? , Yes  The language is hard to learn   but it's interesting
RightIt ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well , You're right
I hope soYou see   at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent  I'm awfully worried   I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect , Oh   she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class  She doesn't mind your making mistakes   though
There are hundreds and hundreds  English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions , Can you give us an example ?
That is just a natural   grammatical English expression  It has a direct translation in other languages , This is interesting   MsParker
Do you want me to help you ? , Please
You're catching on ! However   there are elective courses like wood shop   metal shop   home economics , I'll take home economics
Sure   what's up ? , I have no idea where my class is
I know where the C building is , Do you mind telling me where it is ?
I actually have a class right around there , Can you please show me ?
Oh I ’ m learning very slowly  I think Chinese is more difficult than English , Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier
Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese , How often do you have English lessons ?
I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week , Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ?
What can I help you with ? , I'm not sure how to find my next class
Well   that's not far away , Could you point me in that direction ?
My next class is around there , Can you show it to me ?
Do you have your book list for your class ? , Yes   I have my list
OK   so once you pass the gym   it's the first door on your left  Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there ? , No   I didn't know I could do that
Well   if you decide to go   I could meet you over there at 1 , Yes   thank you  That would be great
First   you need to have the list of books for your class  Do you have that ? , Yes   I have that
Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left  Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money ? , Really ? How can I do that ?
I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1 , No   thanks  I'm good
Did you come late ? , I couldn't make it
Oh   okay  Well   here you go , Are these all of them ?
Don't mention it , Man   I'm hungry  Do you know a good place to have lunch ?
Oh   I know a place where you might like to eat , Is it close by ?
This will work out well  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it , When are we leaving for our field trip ?
That will be Monday   December 2nd  We need to start loading the buses half an hour early   so plan to arrive at 7 , Yes   I will be there on time
The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p  m  and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p  m , What should we bring with us ?
Yes   I'm hungry  What types of food sound good ? , Maybe just a quick sandwich   salad   or something
It's on the second floor  May I join you ? , Of course ! Let's go
Sure ! What kind of food would you like ? , I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian   maybe
It's right past that last building on the left  Do you want me to go with you ? , That would be great
There will probably be a book list in the bookstore  Do you have your class schedule handy ? , No   I don't have that
When you pass the gym   it'll be the first door on the left  Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money ? , Yes   I knew I could do that  Exactly how do I go about selling them ?
I am free at 1 , Maybe that would work
Yes   I would be happy to help  What do you want to buy ? , I want to buy that candy
Next   you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot  Make sure they are smooth , Yeah   I already knew that
Now you just make your selection and pray  If nothing comes out   try again or call the number on the side of the machine , I hope it works !
Sure   no problem  What are you trying to get ? , I want to buy a drink
First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot  The dollars have to be smooth , OK   what next ?
Choose what you want and push the button  Sometimes it takes a couple of tries , I agree with you
Off campus or on campus ? , I need to find a space on campus
It's on the west side of the campus , Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ?
I went up there early this morning , Do you think it'll be full now ?
Of course   just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished , I'm finished
Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ? , No   I have no idea what they are
Great ! You are all set to enjoy the library , I want to know how to buy something from this machine
Are you ready to go ? , I'm clear so far
Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work , Yes   next step
You seem to have it down  Have a good day ! , I really need to find a parking spot
You can park in the student parking structure , Where is it located ?
Last time I checked   it was pretty empty , What time was it when you went up there ?

I think that the percentage is incorrect , Let's just go over all of it to double-check
I don't see any mistakes , OK   now that we've gotten those straightened out   let's total the score
Yes   you're right , Well then   we are all straight  Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention
I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right , These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure   all right ?
This one right here should be right , Yeah   I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that   right ?
Looks pretty good , Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying !
Both , I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes   too  Will that work for you ?

yes   I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago , congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ?
I was also accepted into Yale University   and Sydney University , if you're worried about money   the cost of living is lowest in America  However   if you go to Oxford University   you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future

have you ever gone abroad before ? , yes   I've been to Tailband   Egypt   and Japan

did you pass ? , I not only passed my test   but I aced it ! I'm so happy !
you don't have to thank me  It's just a part of my job as your counsellor , did you always do well at school ?
sure   but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot  When are your final exams ? , I'll get my finals in two months
do you think that's a good idea ? , no   I think I should study a little bit at a time   starting a few weeks before the exam
it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! , how was school today   Dominic ?
I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today ! , it's just one exam  Can you re-take the exam ?
I don't know  I sat down in my seat   looked at my paper   and then my mind just went totally blank , do you think you studied enough for the exam ?

Don't brother me ! , Hey   Chillon   I'm just trying to help
I drew a blank on ~ about the test , No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ?
I'm thinking of dropping out , You can't do that   Jenny !
well   I finished my last final today , the end of all the hard work for my master's  what a nice feeling to get my degree !
do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? , oh   I think they're provided by the school for that special day
well   most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service   but some of the education majors have had them made   because they will be faculty members   and they'll need them f , then   I might as well have them made
it doesn't matter  Say'cheese ' , here's Lisa  May I take a picture with her ?
oh   Iris   it ’ s about the job with the PR company , it ’ s a great opportunity  You should be happy with the offer
she says a part-time job is cursed blessing  It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys , that may be true  But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them  Why not try it ?
I ’ ll try   but what if she insists ? , just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding  And more importantly   you can manage both your study and the job

how could it be ? , while seeing others going to work or continue their study   I didn't know what I would do
I think you lack in the power of decision  Once you make your decision   don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear  Just go full steam ahead ! , You'll soon graduate from your university  Do you have any plans for the future ?
career path ? I'm not sure , what kind of job do you want after graduation ?
I don't know  Do you have any advice for me ? , yeah   you should first decide what kind of career you really want   plan your career path   and then try your best to achieve your goal
thank you so much for your advice  I'll think it over , how was your education going on in Australia ?
I'm planning to return to China after graduation , why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad
absolutely   many Chinese enterprises are going global   and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business , the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home
It is in that brand new   tall building over there  On the 9th floor , Where is the school cafeteria ?
The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library , Where is the library ?
Sure  Glad to be of service  By the way   my name is Mike Sullivan  You will see me around a lot  I am running for President of the Student Government , Well   hi ! My name is Eve Markowski  I am glad to meet you  With your friendly smile and helpful attitude  I am sure you will win
Have a good day  Bye-Bye ! , hey   Maris   are you a part-timer ?
sure   I have a part-time job as a bartender , cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !
of course  There ’ s always much to learn  I got to know more about the real world , you mean you got working experience   right ?
sometimes it is  But after working for a few weeks   it ’ s easy to figure out , really ? It sounds interesting
Can you speak French ? , Yes   I can   but not very well
About 40 percent   if he speaks slowlyWhen he speaks fast   I can only catch a word here and there  But Mr  Wang is an excellent Chinese teacherWith his help   my Chinese is getting better and better e , What can I do ?
Take the magazines out of the bookcase  Put them in that box , All right
Of course , Thanks   John
I'll do it someday  But it's not the right time now  I have to learn a lot by working as an employee , it sounds like you've got a perfect plan
yeah   the success stories of that company might be useful for me  And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company , that's right  You should establish good relationships with them  what else are you planning to do while working for that company ?
hello ! How are you today ? , hi  I ’ m feeling very nervous  I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did
let ’ s go and get a coffee together  That will help you to wake up again ! , ok  I feel like sitting down and having a chat  How have you been recently ?
I hate spending too much time at home  I get bored of it really quickly  I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people , perhaps I ’ m being too shy  I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests !
Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? , Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for  Besides   I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes
Do you have a subscription ? , Yes   I do  The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month  Do you every buy magazines ?
Oh   it ’ s the latest novel by ray blue  It ’ s a sic-fi thriller , I thought he usually wrote horror books
Yes   I would  I need to buy a textbook for my course and   as you know   I love browsing through the latest paperbacks , Me too  I need something to read on the flight to new york  I can never sleep on planes  Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter
What are you doing ? , I ’ m just looking at this map of the world  I ’ m preparing for a geography class
The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water  Compared to the oceans   most countries are tiny , I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall
It ’ s all so interesting  I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet  Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class , Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ?
There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs  We have a subsidiary company l , Are the reports favorable ?
Not really  They all seem to focus on the election  There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week , I ’ m not surprised  That article certainly added fuel to the debate  Ok  Thanks  Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them
There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions  I enjoyed reading her thought  The which ? section is very interesting this month  They tested facial cleaners  T , I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine
Oh   I see  I like to do those tests   too   but I don ’ t take them seriously , Of course not   but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do  According to the jealousy test   I ’ m quite a jealous type of person  Perhaps I need to control my jealousy
Yes   I do  I find it very informativeIt always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too , Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ?
Let me see  There ’ s the news section   the entertainment section   sports   business   and world affairs , What ’ s in that section ?
What are you reading ? , It ’ s an article about language  It talks about the idea of having a single global language
Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? , The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost   but others will continue to be used for generation   even if English continues to be the dominant language
But it ’ s so old , Don ’ t judge a book by its cover  Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ?
I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel  What ’ s the main storyline ? , It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls
Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? , No   that ’ s the problem  Though they are well-off   once he dies   his house will go to his cousin  So   when he dies   the girls will have nothing
There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! , That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first
Ok  That sounds like a deal , What are you reading about in that science magazine ?
According to the article   you have no real need to worry  Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts   not on recreating a whole human , In the future   that could be possible
I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines  For example   an animal be immune to disease that affects human  So   scientists find out why it ’ s immune , That ’ s great   because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves  I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones

In the nineteenth century   working conditions were appalling   with workers being forced to work ten   twelve   and fourteen hours a day  Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly   despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders   and by April 1886   250 000 workers were involved in the May Day movementPrevious legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed   so labor organizers took drastic measures  They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work  And   on May First 1886   the resolution took effect , Cool !

Yes   they say I would get a big sum , Have you discussed it with your wife ?
I have to think about it , Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test  Is that right ?

Whatever brought us together   I'm happy , I dislike Susan  She is always above herself
Sure , Hello   Dora   I haven't seen you for a long time  Where have you been ?

Some people aren't very considerate , We're going to do something about it
We'll play the CD loud   is that all right ? , I don't think so
Good idea , Do you think you could keep the noise down ?
I'm sorry  I thought you wouldn't mind , Mike   did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ?
That's an understatement  I'm on cloud nine  I couldn't be any happier , Did you tell your parents yet ?
I think so  It's turning out to be a great day , Hello ?
I just watched a movie and I'm scared , What did you watch ?
If you're not busy   do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone , Sure  I can come over  What should we do ?

I'm dead serious  Yesterday   before class starts   she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes   ‘ Good morning   Jim  ’ , Oh   gag me ! She's totally gross !
Jack   what's wrong ? , You !
No  that's not what I meant  I didn't mean that  She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara  I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends , She started feeling suspicious after you said that
Look  I really didn't mean to   and next time I see Martha   I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends , Don't bother
The bus I took , What do you mean ?
Is there anything I can do for you ? , Yes   the fried chicken is too hard to eat  I suggest you bring me another one free of charge

OK  Come back into the classroom   class , Does the class start again   Mam ?
come on   baby  It ’ s time now , Mam   another minute   could I ?
Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress , No   I'm not  I try and try and I still can't speak it very well
Are you an American ? , Yeah
Oh   do you like Chinese ? , Yeah   I'm eager to learn Chinese   but it is too difficult for me
When will we begin ? , How about tomorrow night ?
No  It's all Greek to me , She's speaking French   not Greek
I wish you the best of luck , Are you a newcomer ?
Thanks   but I speak English with a strong German accent , But let me tell you   you're doing just fine  I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning GermanBy the way   how long have you been learning English ?
Yes   I am , Is this your first year in college ?
I transferred from PCC , How do you like it here compared to PCC ?
Don ’ t get me wrong  I like it here   but PCC is better , So   why did you leave PCC ?
As a matter of fact   I am , Have you just started college ?
I transferred here from PCC , Do you like it here ?
I like PCC better , If that ’ s the case   then why did you leave ?
Yes   I am , Will this be your first year ?
I transferred from PCC , Why ’ d you transfer here ?
PCC is great ! , I hope you enjoy it here
Ready for what ? , Are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
Of course I ’ m nervous , What are you most nervous about ?
Why not ? , Meeting new people is a good thing
Yes   I ’ m new , Is this your first year in college ?
I was at PCC before , Why did you transfer ?
PCC is an incredible school , Well   I wish you luck here
Yes   I am new , Is this your first semester ?
I came here from PCC , Do you like it here so far ?
I think PCC is a lot better than here , Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ?
This is my first day here , Are you a freshman in college ?
I started at PCC , What made you transfer ?
I loved PCC , Good luck here
I can ’ t seem to make a decision , Where do you want to go ?
I like it here at PCC , Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ?
I completely agree , So   have you made your decision yet ?
Am I ready for what ? , Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ?
I ’ m very nervous , Why are you nervous ?
That makes me nervous , It ’ s fun meeting new people
I can ’ t think of where to go , Where would you like to go to school ?
I really like where I ’ m at now , So   why don ’ t you just stay here ?
You ’ re absolutely right , Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ?
Yes  You've done a good job  But there's one thing  You should narrow down your topic , What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
Of course ! Let ’ s have a look  Great ! In my frame of mind   I ’ d like to buy one today , Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful
Oh   shut up   will you ? It was all your faultIf you'd kept quite this would never have happened , Oh   so it was my fault   was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse
What happened ? , No one would listen to any of my suggestions  Instead   they just kept arguing with each other
Well   I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes , That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say  Then he expected everyone to agree with him
It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient , Exactly  I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share   but they just wouldn't let me finish  What should I have done to get my point across ?
You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting  Not everyone needs to know all that information , That's a good idea   I think I will try that at the next meeting
Look at the view from the window , Oh   dear  That ’ s terrible  Not at all what I expected
It can ’ t be helped , Wow  She can be really nasty   can't she ?
She even stayed at a different hotel  She said I might be contagious , Well   at least we have Starscom  That'll be great publicity
I got your e-mail a couple of months back , Yeah ? Which one was that ?
I'm going for a walk   Yi-jun  I need some time to myself , Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight
I need to come to grips with his death first  And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow , OK   but don't forget I'm here for you   and I know how you feel  It's my loss   too
But Sandra  you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position  It's perfect for you ! , Yeah  I know  But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
So he talks about you behind your back ? , Yes  He's all nice and friendly to my face  But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !
My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits  She liked to name-drop  we would be in a meeting and she would say   yesterday I was chatting with Tom  She meant Tom Solomon  our CEO , Oh   no  It looks like we're late
They're probably up front  The preacher's about to speak  Let's listen , That was such a touching speech  He must have really known Taylor well
Don't build a fire under me  I know the importance of time , But you are too slow to follow them
I quite agree with you  They are terrible  They are complete waste of time   but my wife disagrees with me , Actually   what bothers me is the violence  There are far too many detective and police shows
Wedding rings ! , Oh   no
No  I just like looking at wedding rings   OK ? , Women are such dreamers
I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long , What happened ?
Emm  yes  But I wasn't too impressed  I found her a little stuck up , You are kidding   but she's so helpful
I don't think so actually  She never even says " hello " to me , Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment
It's a little eerie  I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me , Well   I think it's fabulous  And the neighbors don't even seem to exist
I'm terribly sorry I'm late  I just couldn't help it , It's really very easy saying you're sorry
I just lost my job  My boss just told me , That's unbelievable  Why did this happen ?
Harry was angry last night , That's because he's getting nervous  Anyway   this is the first time he's directed a play
He got the scholarship to Harvard , You're kidding !
I don't like this movie  It's a bomb , Look   I've already paid for the tickets   so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it
My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face , Oh   don't worry  I just killed a pigeon
Thank you so much for coming tonight  Everybody really enjoyed your performance , I'm glad I could help
I know   but you deserve it , The boss announces the pay raise today   right ? How much do you think we'll get ?
Well   anything is better than nothing  Wait and see , What do you think about violence in movies ?
If you ask me   I have to disagree  Something shouldn't be watched for fun , I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year   money is just too title
Surely   there are other ways to save money , What are you talking about   we tried everything !
How about the new bar across the road ? , Sounds good  The food there is fantastic too
Too much   Harry  Don't blame her anymore , But it was her that makes us so embarrassed
You won one million yuan in a lottery  What will you say ? , I don't know  I'm too excited to say a word
When he told me I had to work overtime   that was it , The last straw   huh ?
I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug , There's no need to apologize
You didn't tell me she was married ! , I tried  You were preoccupied
That guy was definitely a Don , So now you can say you had a mafia experience  Ha-ha
Is there something wrong ? You look so sad , My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture
Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you   too ? Look ! , What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing   but sexual harassment is crossing the line
Hello  I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ? , Just one moment  I'll check with the cancer ward desk
That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith , Yes   ma'am  He died from complications of stomach cancer  I'm very sorry
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust , This has been the worst and best day of my life   Taylor  They kept you in the hospital   and
You ladies look very elegant in black  But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come , You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled   right ?
No   but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today  My mailbox must have been overflowing , How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes
And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves , But you're not to blame for them keeping him there
Great   then let's go visit him  I want to give him some flowers   too   to say sorry , Sorry ! Excuse me ! I got your message
Oh   Taylor ! I'm so  so happy  But then  who's that ? , Taylor Smith  But not me  The pallbearers are carrying out the casket  It would be rude to just leave  Let's follow
But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work , Poor Femi  Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him
Did everyone fill out their entry permits ? , Yes  The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants
That's because it's time , Time for what ?
Why not ? I've got the rings ready , I don't know what to say   Jack !
Yeah  Dig my new pants ? , Copycat !
No  Mine are a soft brown  Yours are khaki , Whatever
It will be  And today is   too  I just talked to the airlines , They're going to give us back the seats ?
You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas , Oh   Jack ! That's wonderful !
Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful  It was worth the wait ! , Thank you  Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet
That's very nice  Is it for sale ? , No  I never sell my artwork
Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year ! , Remember   real luck must be created ( by ) yourself   and then it cannot be given or taken away
Actually   it's better , What ? Are you kidding ?
OK   OK  Get back to work  There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen , Thanks for helping me up
That takes talent , I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing !
No   and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at ! , Well   he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back   doesn't he !
What ? I don't get it , Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies  He meant that you turned it into a comedy
I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor  Ha-ha , Of course ! That's why I always say   Eat   drink and be Greek !
Believe me   the time will fly by ! Before you know it   you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing ! , I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room  What do you think about lavender ?
Yes   I did , What did you think of it ?
Oh   I'm not sure I agree with you  It was not a good one   but it was not the worst one  Actually   it wasn't too bad , I can't think the same
Excuse me   Supen , I hope nothing is wrong
My daughter isn't feeling well , Oh   no  Is it serious ?
Thank you  It's our first date  I hope it's not too offensive , Not at all
Congratulations on your success , Thank you
He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study   really ? , Yes  He ’ s already got the passport and visa
You didn't ring me last night  You said you would , I'm sorry to have made you disappointed
And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? , Forgive me darling  I'm very tired
I don't agree with you  It's too small to live , It has fresh air   and it is nicer than a big town
Well   alright   I agree with you about that   but I still prefer a big town , What a great weekend that was !
I couldn't agree with you more , We should come here more often
That's exactly the way I feel , I ’ m so excited   mother  Oh   a new baby !
Do you think so ? Well   I guess  He does look a lot like me  Oh   he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though , Yes   he does have Richard ’ s eyes  The baby even looks like you than Richard does
You often like comparing children with their parents , You ’ re right
Do you like this campus ? , Well  I ’ m rather disappointed with it
Oh  It ’ s awful   but it can ’ t be helped , I ’ ll just have to put up with it
You know  I took part in the Chinese contest  I was the best and they gave me this reward  I don ’ t have to pay for my trip , Congratulations  How lucky you are !
I ’ m sure I will , Have a nice journey   Lily
I ’ m not in the mood , Why are you feeling depressed ?
But she did and made me disappointed , Oh   cheer up  A girlfriend is not everything
Oh  I just can ’ t forget it , You ’ re all set now ?
I really appreciated it , I was happy to help
You ’ re a real friend in need , You look so happy   Anna  Any good news ?
Thank you   Paul , By the way   would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday
Sure   I will  Thank you for inviting me , My pleasure
But there's a bus every ten minutes   and you are over 1 hour late , Well   I missed several buses
Oh   come on   Gordon   it's the afternoon now  Why were you late really ? , Well   I  I lost my wallet   and I
When ? , This morning  I mean
Sorry   but I ’ m not really interested in those things , But they ’ re very nice   you know
Oh   I don ’ t care about that , Everybody is buying them
I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion , I see
How about a movie tonight ? , It doesn ’ t matter to me
How about a snack after work ? , I couldn ’ t careless
Are you really interested in doing something ? , I don ’ t mind if you want to
Why not ? , I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to
Would you like me to give you a lift ? , No   thanks  His home is not far and I can walk there
You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout , I ’ m not crazy about it at all
Yes   that ’ s funny  I thought you liked it , I hate it
What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable , It's us
That's right , And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself
You mean I am groaned a few words ? , Totally not  Perhaps it's about our marriage
In times of loss   it is often hard to pick up the phone  But his whole family was here , His mom and dad must be destroyed  He was their only son
This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location , Hey   Mary   can you cut that out ?
Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! , I don ’ t slurp my coffee  And plus   how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?
Fine  Let's call a truce  I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down , Yeah   I ’ ll try to do the same  So   I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ?
My mattress was supposed to be delivered today , Is there a problem ?
I was late for work because of them , Again   I do apologize for the inconvenience
It shouldn't be a problem , I'm going to refund your money right now
I'm afraid not  But at tomorrow's funeral   the family requested an open casket service , This is all too fast  He's my best friend   and now he's gone
The mosquitos are biting me ! , Me   too   I can ’ t stop scratching  They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks
Then we ’ ll have to put up with it , We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us   they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep
Hi   Daniel   how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss , Thank you   I ’ m doing much better  I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral
Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? , No  Wendy is being cremated  She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried  I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean
Dan   Dan   dude  You have to come over to my house right now ! , Is everything OK ?
So   since when is your house a bank ? , What do you mean ?
What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? , Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan   we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers   solicitors   even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis
Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death  I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off , What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face
Why are you so rude to your wife ? , I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her  She's a chatter box
Jenny   what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? , Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night  I got to know the fact that you are playing the field
Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? , What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking
I know   I know  I am really trying   but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit  I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? , Fine ! I want a divorce !
It isn't your fault  No one will blame you , You are so thoughtful
I was so angry that I could not keep cool  What I need is just an apology , I think that ’ s settled
Why not ? , You are blue in the face   arn't you ?
I'll beat him , So beat the cat   but don't kill it
John is a peacemaker  He simply doesn ’ t bother  He says he should give him a free hand , It ’ s really terrible !
You said it  Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children , What are you thinking about ?
You are really a wet blanket , Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley  And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at
Come on   Nancy  Play it cool  I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight , How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day  Congratulations !
Yeah  I'm lucky to be his wife , He's after your own heart   it is important
John's father got married again , Married whom ?
He married a girl who is only eighteen ! , Is that true ? But anyhow   it's none of our business   isn't it ?
I hope so , You seem to be in the seventh heaven  What's put you on ?
No   I encourage her to go her own way   but she's now having a change of heart , You seem to have all the jitters about Jane
I do have the confidence   but I still worry about her , Are you an American ?
Oh   my mother is a German   so I can speak German , Oh   do you like Chinese ?
Very Good  I'd like to do that , When will we begin ?
Lisa wins the first prize in the English speech contest of her college , Really ? That's really wonderful  I'm so happy for her
I feel confused about the grammars , I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best
I know that   mom  But sometimes I'm just sad , Keep your chin up  Remember ? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart
Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress , No   I'm not  I try and try and I still can't speak it very well
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit , Yeah  Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian  She's almost driving Li Na crazy
What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ? , Perhaps they should give it a second thought  The residents are getting up in arms about it
I like them very much  They are delicious , Well   you can have all my carrots
Oh   you want my chocolate cakes   so to speak ! , No   no   I'm just thinking of some dessert  And I have had enough carrots
Oh   stop it ! You know you need vegetables  You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet   now , Well   actually   I don't mind eating carrots   but chocolate cakes are much better  You know I was born with a sweet tooth
I hope so  But I'm always caught short , But the darkest hour is the nearest dawn  I bet you'll soon turn the table
Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? , Of course   my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child
Really ? It's a deal  Have you ever been there ? , Yes   I went there five years ago  You were still a baby at that time
Can I see the rainbow ? , That depends  If you are lucky   you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks
What do you think about the teachers ? , To be honest   I like most of them   except for my Chinese teacher  She is quite young   but her class is too boring !
What is he like ? , He is great  He always tells us not to study for exams   and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing
Oh   that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher , Absolutely ! If you come to our class   I am sure you will like him
Well   don ’ t just sit there   do something  Come and help me in the kitchen , Help you in the kitchen   I don ’ t feel like it
Not   if you don ’ t want to , Well   isn ’ t there anything you want ?
Do you love me ? , I ’ m very fond of you
why didn ’ t you answer my question ? , what question ?
Don ’ t cherish your words   dear , I---I don ’ t feel like saying it
I don't think so  Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that , Then it must be a naughty boy who did it
He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark , He was too desperate to find some other way
I am tired of doing that boring work  I just repeat doing counting everyday  It's so terrible , Me too  But I think we can do something else for a change
Yes   that's in the past  Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help , Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation
That sounds interesting  But I don't know how to do that , How about a training course ?
OK   let's have a try , OK
But you should have told me you were in love with her , Didn't I ?
Yes   but you might have told me before , I didn't think you'd be interested
Oh   you men ! You're all the same , Would you like a cup of coffee ?
What's the matter ? , This machine is out of order
You ought to complain  These machine are always out of order , How was the movie last night ?
I found it very disappointing , She liked the acting   too   because that's what she wanted to see
How's your new car ? , Perfect  Couldn't be better !
No regrets ? , I'm really pleased with it  Thanks

She married Jerrod , You ’ re kidding
I just had a terrible week , What a shame !
Then my son drove into a tree , I'm sorry to hear that
And a storm blew our roof away , Ho   no !
I am afraid so  I am terribly sorry ! , Whatever am i going to tell me parents
You can always take it again , Are you Elvin ?
Easy stuff  But thanks  And the admiration is mutual , It is ?
Hi   Elvin  How are the new programmers I got for you ? , Stay away from me
That won't be necessary   Elvin  Look   I want to apologize for your nose  I'm sorry , Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you
Don't know what ? , Let's just say there could be some big changes around here
Come on   grow up  Have you seen Vince around ? , Just remember  The main thing right now is to make sure Starscom is happy
I'm OK  I'll be fine  I'v cool  I'm cold  I'm like ice  She won't know what hit her , By the way   how's the nose ? Boy   that must have hurt
So you'll make the Starscom deadline   and have us up and running next week ? , It'll be close   but we'll make it
Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? , You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers
Did you hear the names he was calling me ? , I heard  But did you have to tear out his nose ring ?
She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Starscom web site by the end of next week , What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ?
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? , I quite agree with you  They are terrible  They are complete waste of time   but my wife disagrees with me
You are absolutely right  They are too brief  They don't tell you anything , I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss  What shall I do ?
Maybe not   but I advice you to say it was your fault , All right  But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes  They ’ re dull
Because  oh   all right  You win  Let ’ s pay for them and go , Hey   thanks   mum
Did you have the room checked before we move in ? , Which room are you in ?
what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? , I'm sorry  I forget all about it

A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games , That's incredible  I cann't believe it
You didn't ring me last nightYou said you would , I'm sorry to have made you disappointed
And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? , Forgive me darling  I'm very tired
I did  But they said they won ’ t change them , That ’ s terrible  But if they wouldn ’ t change them   I know what I would do
Yes   I do  This one is very old now , They look all right to me
What happen   John ? , Nothing
Oh   cheer up  He ’ ll understand you , David   why didn ’ t you clean the room ?
I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me  That ’ s a real let-down , I don ’ t think she will do such a thing
But she means a lot to me , Then forgive her mistake
What did he say ? , He advised me to change to a more suitable course
It is stupid to say so , Mum   can I finish my homework later ?
That ’ s out of the question , Please
Sorry   it ’ s impossible , What's the matter ? You don't look well
My exam , Oh   is that all ?
Shall I get you another cup of coffee ? , Yes   please  That is very kind of you
Good morning   Loans , Good morning   Mr  Smith
Yes  And we're proud of you   Loans , It's nice of you to say so
Yes  Yesterday , Good gracious  That ’ s incredible !
She ’ s going to live in Paris , Really ? I ’ m surprised
That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here   didn ’ t you ? , It ’ s true  But I can ’ t show my abilities
Well  How do you know ? , I just had a terrible week
That's too bad , Then my son drove into a tree
What a pity ! , And a storm blew our roof away
It's still early , Gosh   it's already 10Stay here if you like
What a charming room ! It faces south   and there's such a lovely view of the city , I'm glad you like itThe bell is on the bedsideJust ring if you want anythingThe room attendant speaks a little EnglishSo I don't think you'll have any trouble
Is it a two-pin socket ? , Yes   it is
It's an excellent one  I like it very much , Why ?
My friend Jane is very beautiful , What's her figure ?
Dark blue , how old is she ?
You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness , What do you mean ? It will help us to relax
I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends , That's a good idea  I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpongPerhaps we can make a foursome with them
All right , What a terrible house !
It's no use complaining  If we had got enough money   we couldn't put up with it   and would have moved out , Sure
But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts , Ok  I ’ ll try my best to calm down first
It ’ s all right , I was caught in the heavy rain   or I would have come earlier  I am sorry I kept you waiting
I totally understand , Mary seems depressed  What ’ s the matter ?
Hi   Becky   what's up ? , Not much   except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall
For example ? , Well   last week I invited her over to dinner  My husband and I had no problem with the food   but if you listened to her   then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables  There's just nothing can please her
My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us  If it wasn't disciplining them enough   then we were disciplining them too much  She also complained about the food we fed them   the schools we sent them too   and everything else under the sun , You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?
Come in   come in ! , Hi   Gary   what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater  Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?
I ’ m sorry  We must have misunderstood each other , Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?
Do you have to leave soon ? , No  Actually I can stay longer  Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty

Right  I only knew a few English sentences , That's incredible  Could you tell me what you did to make a start ?

It's about a girl  No   an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now , But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet !
The 1879 Large Dragon ? Are you serious ? How much ? , Hey ! I thought you weren't interested ! Sorry   I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest

Mysteries of the Pyramids  Didn't we watch this program last week ? , Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress   but it ’ s too expensive
I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money , Anyhow   this dress is really elegant
Hi   Mary ! You're here already  Where's Harry ? , He isn't a punctual person  We may have to wait for a little while
I'll never ever work together with him ! , What happened ? Quarrel again ?
Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars  They do everything together , Birds of a feather flock together
this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax , cooking makes me feel relaxed  So   what are we cooking ?
that's a good idea  Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? , that's a bit high for lasagne  I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there
I don't think it's broken , well   if it's not broken   then you need to learn how to vacuum better   because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages !
what do you mean ? , I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us
you're right   but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering , what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
well then   there's a Central Park  Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world , what are all they for ?

Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? , I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me  Luckily   I managed to start it up and drive it here  What do you think it is ?
Well missy   the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator  You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission  You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died , Ugh  So how long is this going to take ? An hour ?
Lady   you look unhappy  What ’ s the beef ? , A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi
Oh   no ! I ’ Ve been assigned to work with Jerry for our group project , Oh ! I heard that he loves to boss people around
You are an eager beaver , Thank you  I just consider working as part of my life
Hey   your Chinese is coming along ! , You think ?
Hang in there  It ’ ll all come together one of these days , Let ’ s cross here

Do you like playing tennis ? , I don't find it very exciting
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus , YeahEspecially when you have something urgent to do
I'm tired of dancing , But to me it's really enjoyable
I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore , Young people enjoy pop songs more
What a boring film ! , The acting of the heroine is too artificial
But it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health , I don't care !
I'm sure you'll soon begin to like itIt ' s such an interesting subject , But I don't think I'll ever show my liking to math
Sorry   Miss  I'll place it immediately   can I get you another drink   or you wait ? , No   please don't do that  I'd just like to return it
Ok   Miss  I hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner , Bother the flies !
I can't see it , Can you be serious for a moment   we've been dating for 6 months now   I really like you  I'd like to take a relationship to the next level
How should I say it ? , I don't want to be like this  I think we should get step further
Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek , It was only the cheek
So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? , Definitely not
I'm not at all keen on that sort of jobIt makes me crazy , How come ?
YeahHe never stops asking questions , Maybe he's abnormal
I wish I hadn't chosen this job , That woman is a thorough drag !
Maybe there's something wrong with her , i saw lily for the first time  and fell like i'v been struck by lighteningshe is a girl of my dreams  i have a date with her on Friday   but i really can't decide what to do
well   there is a play on campus this weekend , good idea  that ' s why i think i have culture  you have any other suggestions ?
what about going on a picnic ? , Cool   but what if the weather is not ideal ?
Do you like our new history teacher ? , I'm fed up with his endless talking
My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present  Look ! , So cool ! Can I get a load of it ?
I am really impressed with your presentation skills , Thank you  I have been working on it for several years
Thanks   but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! , Rock music really leaves me cold  What about you ?
It can't be expressed by words , I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonightSeen from what you are dressing   you really look like a fox
Well   apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill  I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night  I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do , That ’ s true  For the Junior Executive Room  three nights  yes   your bill should be $ 1 500
When I booked the room   your staff didn ’ t mention this  And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that , Are you quite sure ?
Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate , Normally I couldn ’ t do that  But under the circumstances   I ’ ll see what I can arrangeCustomer satisfaction is our primary aim
Thank you  I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team , The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done  I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client

So   Emily   how was your day ? , I don't think you really want to hear about it
Why ? What happened ? , Well   he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them   my manager blamed them on me !
Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? , He treats everyone pretty poorly   but the way he treats me really takes the cake !
Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? , Not really  I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion
That's so true  When you have a taste for success   you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way , I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !
Have you ever talked to them about it ? , I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in   but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !
They soud like the neighbours from hell ! , They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant   they're also terrible gossips  They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment
What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? , Most of my other neighbours are scared of them
Well   perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better  Maybe once you get to know them   they'll turn out to be more sensitive , I think you're being a bit optimistic  If you met them   you'd understand
Let ’ s go for a joy ride , Are you alright   Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are
First   I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work , What did your boss say ?
That was my second time  The first time   I was in a car accident , Is your boss Chinese ?
I think I'm going to look for another job  I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss , That sounds like a sensible plan  Do you want me to help you with your job search ?
Today is your birthday  First of all   happy birthday to you ! , Thank you for coming  We will have dinner outside  Eat up !
This is just for you  Cheers ! Bottoms up , En  it tastes good  I appreciate what you have done for me
Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious , Thank youThanks to the baker   I benefit a lot from him
I find that every employee here respects that manager very much , Yes  He carries a lot of weight  Everyone here is willing to follow his orders
Hi   why do you look so depressed today   Mike ? , I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday
I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood  But why not take it easy ? , Yeah  It's so nice of you to comfort me
Oh   my god ! He ’ s so perfect , Jane   what do think about this dinner ?
Perfect  It really hits the spot , Hurry up  Time is running out
Dear   don ’ t worry  The police can help you , Mom   look   that cake looks delicious  My mouth is watering
What a bone head ! Be careful next time , It ’ s dangerous  I don ’ t dare to go
thanks ; do you like it ? , not really  I was being sarcastic  Does it come with the job ?
I don't mind it   actually  I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day , so are you enjoying your new job ?
I like the fact that I get to work with people  It makes the day go by much faster , that's good  Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department
how do you know her ? , she's my cousin
well   now that I know that   maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime , that's a good idea  Let's discuss after work
Hey   Cindy   I ’ m so sorry about yesterday  I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone , Don ’ t worry about it
Yes   you ’ re right  Good night , you're rather energetic today  What's going on ?
it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ? , not that well  I've got that Monday morning feeling today
your boss is a real salve-driver   isn't he ? , you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work !
maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all ! , no   he is  Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes   but not my boss  He always follows the rules to a T
ok   I'll see you in a bit , alright  See you later !
what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! , didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ?
then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! , we finally took off   but about 30 minutes later   the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight
so where did you land ? , we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again
have you had anything to eat ? , I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant  How about you ?
yes   do you like it ? , I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar  Is it in good condition ?
well   first of all   it needs a new engine   which is extremely expensive , when's the last time you had it serviced ?
they do  Once my son was born   there was no reason to drive this car anymore  It's only a two-seater   you know ! , what else is wrong with it ?
the brakes don't really work that well anymore either , why don't you get it all fixed ?
so   how should we go to the theatre ? , let's take the bus
it wasn't just once  Every single time I take the bus   something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus , we could take the subway   but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice
we're already late   so I think we had better take a taxi , I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours  Let's just take the bus
don't worry  Nothing bad will happen  I'll even buy your ticket for you , thanks   that was nice of you
I am just casting pearls before swine , You can take this car into consideration  It works well and its price is reasonable
I certainly did  Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? , sure
I understand  The last time I went on a business trip with the boss   I didn't even have enough to eat ! , I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses  I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !
I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today , thank you  I can't imagine getting much done today  I'm just too exhausted !
are you ready to go the concert ? , yes  Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ?
is your helmet comfortable ? , not really   but I liked the design   so I got it
is that your new bicycle ? , yes   my father gave it to me for my birthday  Do you like it ?
I can fix those for you  Is there anything else wrong with it ? , well   my saddle is too low for me  Do you know how to change the height ?
it's possible  Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go , Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager  He acts like the point man
Oh   I ’ m sorry , Did you get any pizza ? When I got there   only small one was left  What a pity !
She can cope with it  Don ’ t be such a wimp ! , You are freaking me out
Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? , What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking
I know   I know  I am trying but   I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit  I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? , Fine ! I want a divorce !
Ok  I ’ ll talk to you later  Bye , Carrie   are you ok ? You seem a bit down
Yeah but   he is always in a really foul mood  I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but   he always shuts down and brushes me off , Men are like that you knowThey can feel nervous   anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness
You are something else you know that ? , Hi   I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle  The name is Jimmy Fox
Yes   we do   unfortunately we ran out of cars , But the reservation keeps the car here  That ’ s why you have the reservation
But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like , Fine  I ’ ll take the compact
Look at what you have done  All thumbs , I ’ m so sorry   and I will pay much attention to it later
It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was  Damn it ! , What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars  A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks , And it's a brick ?
I wanted to  But he said   no   the box is still in its plastic wrap from the storeIf it's opened   other people won't believe it's new , So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic
He said he had to get rid of them  They were stolen , Aha ! Now I understandYou were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalkSo   what I think is   you deserve to get cheated !
You're right   Sarah  I was a fool  I can't believe it  How could I fall for such a trick ? , Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter   Ed ! Give us some good news  How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?
Well sir   our sales have dropped   no plunged   fifty percent in the past month alone  We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast  The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory   or getting rid of our staff  If we consider redundancies   it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages  It ’ s a real mess , For crying out loud  How fast are we losing money ?
Oh   that ’ s the really bad news  Our supplier suffered QC problems and   well   half of our production is faulty  We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter  And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost , Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess !
There is some really good news though ! , Really ? What !
Darlene ! Indeed   it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow   you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! , Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about   but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !
He is such a handsome guy  He gets his looks from his mother of course ! , Thank you ! What about your daughter   Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently
But of course ! Well   it ’ s been great talking to you   but I have to get going , Same here ! We will catch up soon   maybe over coffee !
hey   Tom   did you enjoy your lunch ? , oh   don't mention it  It was terrible
I see  You simply can't blame the server for this , yes   I know  Fast food is so popular in this district
it was good  I brough lunch from home today , you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America
yes  I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle   don't you ? , you bet  Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America
yeah   it's hard to believe but true , The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise  Time to get paddling
Beth   what date is today ? , Today is Saturday
Oh   i almost forgot  Today is my mom's birthday , Call her on my cell phone  Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness  Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day
Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day , Yes   I am lucky  I was born on Christ ’ s birthday  Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays  When is your birthday ?
Thanks , After eating   we will take down our tent  Then we will pack everything into the canoe   We can shove off by 6
That should work out great  You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated , Happy Independence Day !
Oh   it's made of wool  I like the striped pattern , yes   I adore simple fashions  How does it look on me ?
that's a good idea  When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? , yes   but I bought it when it was on sale   50 % off the original price  OK   what do you think ?
perfect ! , you have good fashion sense   Karen
hi   Lander  What's wrong ? , I can hardly make ends meet these days
true  The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities , definitely  I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month
inflation is more than just the rising prices   I guess  But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation , has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
you said it  I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending , how ?
Your garden is looking beautiful this summer  The flowers are really colorful , Thank you  I have roses   tulips   and daffodils  Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ?
The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low  Would you like me to cut them off for you ? , Thank you ! That would be very kind of you  I have a saw in the garden shed
Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers , Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ?
Steven   I , I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica   I ’ m sorry  I ’ m not a fireman  I ’ m not even from the United States  I ’ m a spy for the Indian government
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly   why did you lie to me ! , I ’ m sorry   I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you  I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you   but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago  This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long , It ’ s a skill  What can I say ? I don ’ t know why   I just have a long routine
True   I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on   even when you show up to class in sweatpants  Tell me   how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? , Not funny
Sometimes it goes fast  And sometimes it goes slow  And the alarm doesn'twork   either , Would you like another one ?
A receipt ? , Yes  I must see your receipt  You can't have your money back without receipt
I'm sorry  I won't do it again , Try to be more careful in future
The headmaster asked them not to do so , Then why isn't there a notice ?
Mom   why do chinese people like to touch my head ? sometimes they even touch my cheeks , That is a part of chinese culture   if they think you are a lovely child   they touch your head and say   how cute you are
But i do not like anyone touch my head , They are just been in friendly   when you are in Roman   do as the Romans do   that means you need to adapt to your enviroment
Does this mean that if i might want those new European bitches   i am supposed to wonder run reget ? , Do you think it is a ~ got give your brain   use it if you really cannot accept it people touch your head   keep distance from them   why not just wear your big flyby hat and ~ is anyone get close to you
Thanks  Now   I have to find a job , What are you thinking of doing ?
Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics   because there are so many possibilities  Few people know where next discoveries will be made , Well   I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment
Will you be checking any bags today , Yes   I ’ d like to check three pieces
I am sorry   sir   there ’ s nothing I can do  You cannot board the flight with that large bag eitherCarry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat  That bag is clearly too big , Now I see  You charge next to nothing for an international ticket   but when it comes to charging for any other small thing   you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me   miss   how much will I have to pay for all of this
Car trouble center  How may I help you ? , My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car !
OK   first of all   can you turn the key in the ignition ? , Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor
No  If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start , So what do you think it is ?
Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? , Yes Anthony   come on in  Have a seat
Okay , I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it  We are going to have to let you go
What ! I resent that ! , Anthony   you were caught making international calls from the office phone   you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol !
It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was  Damn it ! , What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars  A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks , And it's a brick ?
I wanted to  But he said   no   the box is still in its plastic wrap from the storeIf it's opened   other people won't believe it's new , So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic
He said he had to get rid of them  They were stolen , Aha ! Now I understandYou were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalkSo   what I think is   you deserve to get cheated !
You're right   Sarah  I was a fool  I can't believe it  How could I fall for such a trick ? , Doris   I'm glad you're home  I'm terrified  I don't know what to do !
No   it can't be  Really ? Who ? , I don't know  I saw him the first time Tuesday  He was at the cafe  I noticed he was looking at me a lot  Not just the usual looking   but staringHe just kept staring at me  He didn't stop
Did he leave when you left ? , Yes  Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me  He was following me
That's about five blocks  And around corners tooSo he was definitely following you , Yes   he was  I'm not imagining itFinally   just when I got home   I turned around and looked at himHe was just standing there  He didn't smile  He just stood there  It was so obviousWhat should I do ? I'm so scared  Can I call the police ?
Of course you can call the police if you want  That's not what I mean  I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything , I suppose  What can they do ? I don't even know who he is
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! , So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?
Well   noit can ’ t be that hard ! I mean   all you have to do is explain your business   how you are going to do things and that ’ s it   right ? , You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less  Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has   history   etc
Geez  Is that all ? , Almost   the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis  Here you will calculate and estimate sales   cash flow and profits  After all   people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
Um   okay  Well   I just want a trim  Nothing too fancy , Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky   so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks !
Um  no , Okay   but you are going to be my masterpiece !
And this one ? Too flashy ? , Nah   not too flashy
Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you , And I ’ m trying to watch the game   but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !
Oh   your precious game  You watch the same game every year   and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! , Oh no you didn ’ t  You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals   did you ? Why don ’ t you just  just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
Merry Christmas ! , Hey   Mary   can you cut that out ?
Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! , I don ’ t slurp my coffee  And plus   how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?
Fine  Let's call a truce  I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down , Yeah   I ’ ll try to do the sameSo   I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ?
Do you have any bug spray ? , No   I forgot to buy some
That ’ s without a doubt   the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! , Run ! They are thirsty for more !
Come on ! Stop being so vain  You look great ! You are beautiful ! , Yes   I am   but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin  See ?
I think you need to get brain surgery  I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgeryYou look amazing , I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive
Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! , Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly   you take longer getting ready than I do !
I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok   give me your opinion  Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals  I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well , Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants  It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat
Well you should have picked   in the end you always complain about everything , Not everything   just this film  Even the title is ridiculous  and it ’ s so long   those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life   so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back
You see   that ’ s what I ’ m talking about   I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore , Next time   go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings
Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat   drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints , My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ?
Where are you going ? , I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done
Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! , They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles   file my nails   and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
haven't been sleeping well recently , what's the problem ?
yeah   I know   but I find these sorts of things hard to say  They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV  Now I just hope the show will end soon , I understand  I used to live in a dorm with four people  I was great in some aspects  We always went out and and had fun together  But on the other hand   when I wanted some quiet time   and people kept
I am sorry too  I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while  I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend , don't be silly  You guys should spend as much time together as you can  Besides we can go to the beach anytime
hey   what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides   you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while  I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers , Nah   I wouldn't worry about that  But I don't want to be the third wheel  You two should have some quiet time to yourselves
Hi Mary   how's it going ? , well   last night I had a big argument with Ann
really ? What happened ? , it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while   and we decided we could both make it this weekend  Then out of nowhere she called me up   said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee
you know she probably feels just as bad , well   I think I was being a little selfish myself  I know they don't get to see each other very often
the dinner was really good  It knocked my socks off , that's very kind of you to say so  Let's try some after-dinner wines
port   please , excellent choice  I love its smooth flavor
next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine , oh   what's that ?
oh   here's to your health , thanks  Cheers
I'm not sure  I have to check my schedule  Where are you going ? , oh   Jake made a reservation at Friday's
I will never go out with him anymore , why did you say so ?
he made a lot of noises while eating  He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly , are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ?
I have no idea  He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much , maybe he should really something about eating etiquette
What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal , Yes   but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !
What were the odds ? , 20 to 1   in favour of the Cougars !
What is it ? What happened ? , I think someone is stalking me
What did you do ? , I didn't do anything  Finally   he leftBut then I saw him again today  Outside the shoe store  Near the cafe  I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's  But then he came in too
What did you do ? , He followed me all the way home !
Actually   I don't think you can call the police  Not yet at leastHe hasn't done anything  And probably the police will just ignore itBut if anything happens again   then maybe you should call , Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me !
Listen   Carol  Don't let this bother you too muchProbably it's nothing  Just keep your eyes open when you go outIf you see him a third time   and if he follows you again   then I think we should go to the policeBut for now   just try not to worry , Alright  And I won't go to that cafe for awhile
oh ? What's that ? , well   you know I have some students studying for their master's degree  One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy
you refused the gift ? That's terrible , I know   but I really can't accept such an expensive gift  I explained to him why   but he seemed really upset about it  I think he might have taken it the wrong way
Are you cold ? , Yes   a little
There must be buttons  How do they turn it on and off ? , I think it is centrally controlled  They control it at the main desk
What did they say about the air conditioning ? , They said it is centrally controlledAll the rooms are the same  They can't change it
I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed   but she didn't speak English well enoughSo I decided to go to the magazine shop  The one around the cornerAnd I bought an American newspaper , What happened ?
I know  The economy here is having serious problemsBut because the government declared a default   the currency value went way down , So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much
Yes   it's very good  We suddenly have twice as much money to spend hereOur hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? , Yes   and you know what ?
Why not ? We should do it  Because now we can afford it , I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing !
What ? What did you buy ? , It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was  Damn it !
And ? , So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars  A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks
I can't believe how stupid you are  Why didn't you open the box ? , I wanted to  But he said   no   the box is still in its plastic wrap from the storeIf it's opened   other people won't believe it's new
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? , He said he had to get rid of them  They were stolen
That's no problemHe just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap  That's easyAnd probably it's the same shop he got the boxes fromMaybe his friend works in an electronics store  They sell video cameras thereProbably they had a couple video camera boxes lying aroundSo they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like youTwenty dollars a brick  That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks , You're right   Sarah  I was a fool  I can't believe it  How could I fall for such a trick ?
What's wrong with him ? , His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party
I'd like to talk with you again about what happened , Oh   come on  Let's not beat a dead horse
This cake is excellent  Where did you buy it ? , Actually   my mother made it from scratch
She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling  Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing , She wears her heart on her sleeve
And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ? , I ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks  See   here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March
Alright   tell me about the ties you have to your home country , Well   I own a house  actually   I ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors  I have a car at home   and oh   my job ! I ’ m employed by Tornal as an engineer  Actually   I only have three weeks ’ vacation   so I have to go back to work at the end of March
I ’ m sorry   sir   we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time   instead   you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations   you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations ! , You are not being a good sport about this
Yes   you do , He came to work late every day that week  Then on Friday   he didn't show up at all
I ’ m in   let ’ s go ! , OK   make a left here    no wait   I meant make a right  Come on   speed up !
Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! , Whatever  Just turn right here     The freeway will be packed at this hour     let ’ s take a side streetGo on ! Get out of our way ! Move   move !
I ’ m going as fast as I can ! , Yes ! We made it  5:58   just before the library closes

Thank you , How do you think of the weather today ?
Yes   I've been sitting here for a few minutes  I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car , I'm sorry   sir  But this is the self-service pump
Are you serious ? , Yes  Are you traveling here ?
Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how , Well   since this is your first time   I will do it for youBut next time   if you want a full-service gas station   you should look at the sign
I see , Hurry up  We're going to be late
I can't figure out which dress to wear , Oh   no ! Now I'll be late
Sure thing  I've got time , Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ?
I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money , I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you   but I think you're late for work
Thank you  You save me , Excuse me  I'm afraid you're in my seat  You've moved my books
Oh   well   I looked around  There wasn't any other space  I waited a while and nobody came  I'm sorry if I've taken your place , You're acting weird tonight
I guess I'm glad exams are over , Wow ! That's a fantastic movie !
I'm not sure   but I think it must be directed by Zhang You  That's typical of him , I've just been a little depressed lately
Then just keep your chin up , Bob   what are you thinking about ?
Next week , It's taking you forever to do my hair
There you go , I don't think that you're done
What's so bad about it ? , It doesn't look good at all
Well   let me talk to my manager   okay ? , I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday
I have plenty of time to do this  I promise you it won't be a problem for me , Is there a good time for you to help me ?
That would work out well  Bring any concerns that you might have , Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot
Yeah   why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time  A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood  We can go there , Do we need to book a table in advance ?
Why not now ? I'm hungry , What a wonderful party ! I had a good time  How about you ?
Yes   if it's not too much of a trouble , It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place
It was a kind of sixth sense , Does it happen often ?
Why are you considering trying for it ? , I think that I might like it   but I am still thinking about it
Yes   you could be right  There is a lot to consider , I am also wondering about the pay
I think you should give it a shot  What do you have to lose ? You can always change your mind , What's your favorite magazine ?
It's instructive and inspiring , Really ? It is a weekly   isn't it ?
Yes   it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores , Oh   I think I should try to read one
Any rain ? , No   but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow
Of course I can  It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not   I can do 30 push-ups a minute , Really ? I think that's impossible !
It's easy  If you do exercise everyday   you can make it   too , How was my singing ?
Yes   of course  This is a really wonderful party with interesting people and great food , I ’ m glad you are enjoying yourself
Yes   I ’ d love another glass  You ’ re a wonderful host  Thank you for everything , It ’ s my pleasure having you here
Do you play much tennis ? , Yes   quite a bit  How about a game sometime ?

Give me a call tomorrow , Okay
I'm tired of this job , So am I
I'm so familiar with her songs   but I don't know what kind of person she is in real life , My wife gave birth to our first child today
My condolences , I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently   Sophie
Yeah   he has no children   so he sometimes feel s very lonely  I often go to his house to play and talk with him  That makes him feel very happy , Why do you go fishing so often ?
You bet ! , How was your vacation in Paris ?

Why are you all dressed up ? , I've got a date
You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo  Talk about robbing the cradle ! , Well   you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan
Well   how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? , It was fun   I tell you
Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures ? , Sure   we wouldn't miss that for anything  After that   we took a short cut to the park  There was very little traffic   so we got there in less than an hour
What did you do after that ? , We went for a swim in the sea  That was the biggest part of the day  Just look at my nice tan !
Are you ready ? , Not yet
Like what ? , Like renewing my passport   going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone
I don't blame you  Perhaps you could sublet it , Yes   but whom to ?
Tell you what   I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway   so I'll mention it to him then , Well   thanks   Bill  Let me know what happens  That extra money will really come in handy
I didn't know you knew Frank , Yes   we met last year at a conference
Really ? , Yes   he did the same to me
Ben   what are you doing ? , Well   I would say that I ’ m just drifting - - here   in the pool
Have you thought about graduate school ? , No
Now listen   Ben  Look   I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself   and lie around   and drink beer and so on  But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass , Be quiet   Will you ?
I feel like something good to eat , How about going to Joe's Restaurant
Pretty good   Sam  Only the awful weather   you know , That ’ s right  I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here
I would like to have that new style Gl Joe , Have you asked Santa ?
Hello   Mary   where do you work ? , I work for an Internet company
I was wondering if you could company me to the Ball ? , Of course   I will
Goodbye , Let's get together this weekend
I thought you had forgotten , After the trouble I got into last year   no way
I said it's a lovely day  Why don't we go for a walk ? , Well   I feel a little tired
Don't take too long  It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather , I won't be long  No more than ten minutes  Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ?
I tried when you had gone   but I had no luck , Okay   let's both look for it now
I trust you ’ re keeping well ? , I'm doing great   thank you
I wonder Why , Hey   Bob  Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ?
Yes   there's that bar we passed an hour ago , It was great meeting you
Of course   but I'll have to go now , Mary   I think we should stop seeing each other
I don't understand  We were getting along so well , Time flies !
Sure   I'm looking forward to it , What about your parents ?
Okay  Keep in touch , How about going to the cinema tonight ?
Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better , Don't you think it's too bloody ?
Yes   beautiful weather we're having , We can't complain about the weather recently
I hope it will last fine Sorrow  I'm going to have a picnic with my family , How's business ?
Have you ever been to America ? , No   but I'd really like to
Where to ? , Hello   Mary
Hello   Bob , Have you heard the news ?
I am very pleased to meet you , Bob is in advertising
You asked for it , Can you lend me your car ?
Me too , We should do this more often
Yes , Are you going to be okay ?
Julie ! It's good to see you again  How have you been ? , Great  I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand
I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful , They are  And not only that the people are friendly   but also the food is delicious   not to mention cheap
I know what you mean  I could use a vacation myself , Hey   wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ?
Bob and Mary are back together , I'm glad to hear it
Who cares ? , Where are you going to spend your holidays this year   Tom ?
We may travel by sea  It's cheaper , I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves
What do you do ? , I work in a publishing house  How about you ?
I'm a clerk in a shop , Good morning
Nothing much — the same old stuff  A lot of bad news as usual , Well   what ’ s the weather report ?
Not yet  They were holding two men in Ohio   but they let them go  They weren ’ t the criminals after all , What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ?
For example ? , Don't be afraid  Give it a try
He makes me sick , I'm not a VIP
How nice of him ! , Thanks for your help
Okay   thank you , I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains
That might be a little too cold for some people , Yes   you are right
You know   maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone , Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it
That would be a possibility  Where is this fundraiser taking place ? , It is in the hotel ballroom down the street
We will need to know who will be driving the van , The van will be driven by Mary and me
Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening , Peter and Mary broke up
That's a wonderful choice , I have chosen January as the month for this retreat
I think that April would work  Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains , Thank you for thinking of that
I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers , I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday
Why do you think that this would be a good move ? , I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me
I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it  The benefits are much better , Yes   sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice
Don't worry  Everything will be fine , I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year
I like the mountain idea   but I am not so sure about the month of January , You know   now that I think about it   you might be right
We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them , Yeah   that would let us know what would work best
Sure   I think that would be possible  Where is the fundraiser ? , It is in the park downtown
I think that would be OK  Who will be driving it ? , Mary and I will be driving the van
Yes   that would be fine  Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night , Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van   if possible
What day will you need it for ? , We will only be needing it for Sunday
If I give you the keys to the garage   could you bring it back on Sunday evening ? , Sure  We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom  Would that be OK ?
I'm almost done , I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago
I don't understand , You did a horrible job on my hair
I apologize , That's fine   but I'm not paying for it
Nothing much , What's taking you so long ?
All right  I'm finished , I think there's more you need to do
What don't you like about it ? , I just don't like my hair
I'm sure we can work something out , We're thinking about going to America
I believe it'll be very expensive , Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend  You wanna go ?
Just look around ? Ah   that's boring , I'll go myself then
We should do this more often , Yes   we should
Great  What do you think of it ? , The city is small   not very modern   but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city   so the air there is pretty fresh
It sounds great   and is it really cool there ? , Yes   I think the reason is that there is a big lake   and many trees in the Resort
I hope to go there someday , What was that all about ?
She'll be fine , What day is it ?
Isn't it a Sunday ? , No   it's a Monday
What do you think of when you're praying ? , I try to picture the Lord's face in my mind
Excuse me  Do you have the time ? , My watch is a few minutes fast  It's about six forty   I think
I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday , I could help you with that
What would be the best time for you to help me ? , Tomorrow night would work for me
I'll see you then , See you tomorrow night
I love anything with chocolate the best , I like chocolate myself
I haven't ever cared for that myself , Have you ever had garlic ice cream ?
Hi   why do you look so depressed today   Mike ? , I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday
I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood  But why not take it easy ? , Yeah  It's so nice of you to comfort me
I hate to ask you to do something like that , This will not interfere with my work  I promise you that
Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ? , Yes   and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ?
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! , Yes   there must be about a hundred  Do you have a favorite ?
What is your least favorite ice cream ? , I don't like peppermint ice cream
That could be interesting , That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though  Let's order !
It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure , What are your main concerns ?
I am also thinking about the pay , Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ?
Is my hair done yet ? , Yeah   I just need to make the final touches
I like my hair so much , Do you really ?
How much is it for my hair ? , You owe me $ 55
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! , There certainly are a lot  Can you choose a favorite ?
No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ? , I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it
I think that would be horrible ! , I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today !
I want a different hair style , What style do you want ?
Make it a few inches long , Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ?
I honestly want my hair that short , All right   then let's begin
How much longer is it going to be ? , I'm done now  Do you like it ?
Yes   I truly do , I'm glad you like it
Here you go   thanks for everything , Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks
I would like you to give me a different hair style , What did you have in mind ?
I want you to cut it to a few inches long , That's pretty short  Are you sure about this ?
This is what I want , Fine then  Let's get started
How much time do you need ? , There you go  How do you like it ?
I honestly think it looks great , Thanks  I'm glad that I did a good job
Thanks for doing such a good job , No problem   girl friend  I'll see you next time
I think I want to try a new style , What would you like me to do ?
I want my hair to be only a few inches long , Do you really want it that short ?
I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want , Let's do it
This dish taste terrific  Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot   but very good , I like hot food   especially Sichuan cuisine
Come on   it's the weekend  Let's taste and enjoy this meal  Cheers ! , Bottom's up   and you're right  This meal is incredible  I wish I had known this restaurant before  Thanks for bringing me here  I know I'll be back agile soon
I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago   but it hasn't arrived yet , I'm sorry for that   I'm going to check with the chef right now  Miss   I just checked with the kitchen   and they said your order will be coming right up next  Oh   here comes
It doesn't matter , Are you satisfied with the dishes ?
Yes   the food here deserves its reputation  Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 , If you like   I'll take you to a new restaurant next time   I just heard about it from my friend   and he was just raving about it  It's such a great Sichuan cuisine  Would you like to try that ?
Well   let's finish this great dinner first , You said it
That ’ s great  Where did you stay ? , Some friends of my parents live out there   and they invited me there
Not to mention cooler  Did you go swimming ? , I wanted to   but the water is too cold   and I just wetted in up to my knees
What ? , What happened with that guy at the cafe ?
Yes   I am , Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ?
I only know him through the  you are not gonna believe this , Oh   let me guess  Through the internet ?
Do bullfights interest you much ? , Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on
You ’ re a wonderful person   Kathleen , So are you
Don ’ t   don ’ t   don ’ t   don ’ t say that  That   that makes it worse , What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me   either
But we ’ re so right for each other , I know   I know  Well   is there some   is there someone else ? Oh   that woman on television   Sydney Ann
So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? , I heard that Kevin got divorced  Is that true ?
His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion , Poor Kevin   we should do something for him  He is a nice guy and does his job well
You do ? , Yeah   those classics from the great writers
Rock ' n'Roll   I guess , You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ?
I'm nervous as can be , Don't be shy  Have some more chicken
Yeah   it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? , Couldn ’ t be better  And you ?
Isn't it time for dinner ? , Yes   let's get something to eat
That's disgusting , Shall we go for a drive today ?
We'll go tomorrow , Susan ? What brings you here today ?
Not too good yet  Better than I was though , I'm feeling down
It seems like he's not coming , Can you give him a call on his mobile ?
What's the big deal ? , What day is it today ?
Really   who started the argument ? , He did and it's his entire fault
I don't have any plans , You said you like classical music very much  Then who is your favorite opera star ?

Are you serious ? , Yes   I mean it
Hey   come on  It's too early to say that  We can fix things , I have thought about it for a long time  I think it's time to move on for both of us
I knew this would happen some day , Then why didn't you talk to me ?
Have you made the decision yet ? , I think we'll be better off if we are apart
Hi   Jack   how have you been ? , Not very well
Come on  For a man who's feeling so   down   there're usually two reasons  Either his career is going downhill   or he has a broken heart  Since you're so successful   it must be the latter , Well   you're right  I just broke up with Jane
Well   she is not to blame  It's always difficult to choose between career and family , Maybe you're right
You don't look too well  What's going on ? , I just lost my job  I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills
That's tough  What does your wife think about this ? , She's trying to be supportive   but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well
No problem  In the meantime   don't try to worry so much  You'll get through this , Where are you from ?
It's in the South of China , How is everything going with your girlfriend ?
It was a few things  The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary   but she stood me up ! , Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?
I wanted to   but I knew that if I spoke to her   I'd just blow up at her   so I decided to just go home  I called her later that the night   but she didn't answer the phone , I can't believe she would do that to you  It's so dishonest-and rude !
I guess so , So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend  There are plenty of fish in the sea !
What was more exciting   starting college or starting work ? , They're pretty similar   but in different ways  I really can't decide  How about you ?
It's different for everyone   but because I knew school was going to be so much fun   I really got excited about it , But work is a huge portion of our lives  I'm looking forward to making it fun
Excuse me  My name is David Walker  Haven't we met before ? , Well   let me see  Do you work at IBM Corporation ?
Hey Mike  What are you doing tonight ? , Nothing planned  How about you ?
I say we get drunk tonight  I don't want to think about all this stuff , But we have to work tomorrow
I really enjoyed tonight's party  Thank you   Sarah , You're welcome   Bob  It was nice meeting you
I'm afraid so , It's almost 6:00  I'd better be going
What a hot day ! , Yes   summer is coming
Do you want to go to the beach there ? , Yes   of course  And what's your plan ?
It's one of the highlights of the match , What ?
What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher   faster and stronger ' ? , Well   it's better than ' Friendship first   competition second '
What's up   buddy ? You look so upset , I just broke up with a girl  Why didn't she understand that I loved her ?
Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call , I have asked for a talk again   but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet
And good shot ! , A goal !
Oh   really ? That is great news  What does he look like ? , He is tall and slim   fair-haired
Oh   it ’ s love at first sight , I hope the host team loses
But two players of the team have been booked and one is out , What do you think of the former champ ?
I suppose he's not in top form , What do you think of AC milan and the team of Argentine ?
Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet , Steve   when are you going back to America ?
I've really enjoyed your party   Lisa , Not at all   Sam
That's correct , Well   say hello to him for me
I've got to catch the last bus  See you later , Are you still at that work ?
I think I'm quite fit for a driver , But it's very tired
I haven't told them  Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation , What do you do now ?
I was fired last week , I'm sorry to hear that
After the tour I'll have a rest  And then go to find a new job , Best wishes for you
Not so bad   but Kevin does have problems with his wife , What ?
Yeah   I agree with you  But you know   it ’ s just one of those things , Can you tell which team seems to win ?
They're still fighting hard  Let's wait and see , We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States
Hello ! , Hi   what's your name ?
Yeah   my name is like N-A-N-J-U , Oh   OK  That's a nice name   Nandu  And where are you from ?
The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half , The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final
No   it's the Japanese team , Japanese teams always play a dark horse
They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 , If the Phoenix beats the Rocket   it will enter the final
Well   I've been practising for 5 weeks , Is this your best score ?
Did you see his last dive , Yes   it's perfect !
Nothing much  What are you up to ? , I was just concerned about Sam  He hasn't been himself lately
Yeah  He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days , Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it  In the least show him that we're there for him
Sounds good , Which team won ?
They managed a 99:80 victory , It's quiet everywhere in winter
It's snowing heavily  What about taking a walk ? , That's a good idea  Let's go !
I've got it  I like the feeling of stepping on the ice , Yes  Very wonderful
I'm sure he was off-side , But the ref didn't whistle
Hey  Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? , Oh   yes  I got so tired  My son began to cry the moment we got on the train  It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep
Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan , My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks   so we compromised and finally went to the seaside  I think vacation in summer is not good
His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir , And I taught him how to swim in the sea  It was fun and made him braver than before  After we returned home   he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom
But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized , But the Brazilian is tougher
Twelve  He's very sensible for his age , In spring   people are feeling refreshed  They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps  They feel they are full of spirits and energy
That's true  In summer   the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool , I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects   especially the singing of cicadas
Well   winter is a season for relaxation   do you agree with me ? , Well   it's hard to say  For the fields and rivers   winter is a relaxing season   but for farmers   I think they might take a rest physically   but mentally they are still busy thinking   planning and calculating for the working of the next year
I like collecting stamps , But it's an expensive hobby   isn't it ?
Do you play basketball well ? , No   I'm not very good at it  I play just for the fun of it
Hey   Mary   what's up ? , Just so so  Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time   so we decided to meet again tonight
It seems you two are a good match  What qualities do you look for in a friend ? , There's nothing definite I think  I don't have a list or anything   but when I first meet somebody   I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend  It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends
Yeah   I know  A friend in need is a friend indeed  I don't need fair-weather friends either , What do you like to do in your spare time ?
I like rumba and tango , Great  I am not interested in Chinese chess  It is too difficult for me
Yes   it is  But it is full of fun and knowledge  What about you   what do you like to do as hobby ? , I like gardening  I take care of them everyday  I like those flowers and the swing in my garden  If the weather is nice   I would like to lie on the lawn
It's OK  It seems we have a lot in common , Oh   really ? That is great news  What does he look like ?
He is a nice guy and very considerate  I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor , Oh   it's love at first sight  When will you see each other again ?
Oh   David  Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ? , Come on   Mary   you're a total catch  I bet he will call you  Don't worry
What do you like to do in your spare time ? , I like taking photos

Oh   hi ! , Please allow me to introduce myself  My name is Tom
Me ? I guess so  I've lived here for about six years now  Have you lived in America very long ? , No   not really  When I left Vietnam   I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years  Where do you work   Alice ?
Well   Tom  It's good to meet you  I have to go now  I am teaching a class this evening   and I need to get to the college , It's nice meeting you too   Alice
What a beautiful day ! , It is really gorgeous out today  I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain
Well   you could never tell about the weather here in New York , Yes   that's true  Still   it's hard to believe  Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit
Judge from his look   he's a very serious person , As a matter of fact   he is
Oh   hi  I was just watching TV , There's nothing to watch right now

Aright  I'll talk to you later , Ok  Bye

Then you've got a lot of work to do  You need to get her to notice you first , Easier said than done

Well   I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear  That makes you very graceful and mysterious , Yeah   that's a good idea  Let me try it
Sure   more elegant and taller , I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy  The face powder will lighten my skin color

Well  I saw it only once   but for the next two months when I talked to people   I pretended I was the Terminator , Will we drive to the seaside ?
All right  There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third , What other expenses will we have ?

It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves   but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening , Like what ?
If you do have to drive   you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol  Also   your home should use sources of renewable energy , How about recycling ? Does that actually help ?
I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone , I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !

And the host announced that he won it all ! , The air quality in this city is horrendous  The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
As much as I love this city   I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in  Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health , I know what you mean  However   there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming  If it's not the pollution   then it's the natural disasters   deforestation   or the greenhouse effect
I see   so it's similar to global warming ? , They're related to one another   yes
People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations , I think if everyone pitches in   the world will be a better place

That's good  See you on Friday , Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ?
They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys , Some even do make-up slightly  Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ?
You are so Platonic  Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women  They can't resist love   and men cannot resist their attraction either , I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this   that two solitude protect   border and salute each other  '

Some are entertaining   but I find most of them stupid and childish  For example   I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious , Ha ha  I know what you mean  But it's just a movie  They need for the characters to do that
Yeah   but I don't know if it is going to be any good , The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five

I met Amanda through a friend , That's great  Did you start dating right after you met   or did you become friends first ?

The Lakers  Jordan is the only good player Washington has , Do you have girlfriend ?
So ? , So I think I may fall in love with her
That's a big question  Well   if you're in love   maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all , That's what I do
And maybe you suddenly have new interests  I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid  For instance   you used to sleep in every morning   but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging , That's it  She likes dogs so much now   and I begin to love dogs

Yes   but look at it this way   getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people   which is a good thing   right ? , Possibly   but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard  One member's caddy fainted last week !
Oh   my God   you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? , Yup
They killed another hostage , Oh   how awful  What a terrible thing to do
Yes   but that doesn't make them right   does it ? Just because they think so ? , I guess not  My view is that we should give in to their demands   so that innocent people can stop getting killed
Really ? What happened ? , Well   it was in the Balkans during the war  He was only held for three days   and then they simply released him  It was a case of mistaken identity   and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them  It was lucky they didn't kill him
He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live  It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone   it sounded like he was holding up really well , It didn't sound like he was too upset   huh ? What did you tell him ?
The weather is terrible , Yeah  It's been raining a lot these days
I saw the weather report   and it's going to rain for the next eight days , That sucks so much  What are we going to do ?

I mean   this camera function   for instance-how often do you use it ? , Sometimes   but I guess not very often  It's more for fun  Sometimes when I'm on a trip   for example   I can take a picture and send it to my kids  Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately
I can ’ t believe it ! , What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal
I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure , What were the odds ?

Yeah  That can be a good hobby , Hobbies are great  I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do
Of course not  If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out   you can just say whatever you want to me , Great   because I am really mad at William  I mean   what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart   beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb
I haven't seen your father in like 5 years  How is he doing ? , He's not doing too well
Is it due to old age or is he sick , Maybe a little of both  The doctor's can't point out anything specifically  I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth

I am sorry  But I do not have any money to lend to you , Well   I'm afraid I must be going now  I have no idea it was so late
Well   I won't keep you then  It was very nice of you to come to see me , It has been a pleasure  Goodbye
Yes   it's so cold , Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ?
About two months , I can hardly stand these wet and cold days  It seems that it doesn't bother you very much
Spring will come soon  And we will have some pleasant weather then , I hope so
That ’ s smart  What do you usually do to relieve your anger ? , Something like listening to music is a good idea
I think that might work for me as well , Working out is another good way to relieve anger
The time has come to say goodbye , So soon  It seems as if you just got here
I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around , It was fun for me   too  It gave me a chance to get away from my routine
I'll be expecting you then , What day is today ?
Today is May first   2003 , Oh   today's International Labour Day  Is it our working day ?
Hi   Tom  How have you been ? , Pretty good  Actually   I'm quite busy with work  By the way   say ' hello ' to your husband
Fine  Thank you , Life's so boring
I think money will make me happy , You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness
Then I can find something new to do  If I don't have to worry about money   then I don't have to work , That's true   I guess  If I didn't have to work   I think I would be happy
Really ? Well   thanks for saying so , No   I mean it  Look   are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ?
OK , Hi ! Peter  How are you ?
Mr  Clinton   it's nice to see you again , Nice to see you again   too  Peter  How's your family ?
Don't worry  I'm sure you'll do better next time , I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition
Oh ! That's much hetter than I did , Can you tell me how to improve myself ?
It's a pleasure  Come on  I'm on your side , How old are you   Su ?
Yes   I am seven  I am a big girl now , We will have a party here   right ?
Really ? Why ? , You never guess she is going to have a baby
Oh   she is going to be a great mother , Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ?
It's hard to say  I mean   how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is , But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth
Yes  I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards , Which is easier to learn ?
Hi   John ! I haven't seen you for ages , Yeah   I've been out of town
Have you considered upgrading your system ? , Yes   but I'm not sure what exactly I would need
You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now , How can we do that ?
Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too   because most new software programs are coming out on Cds , That sounds great  Thanks
Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ? , Hop in   I'll give you a ride
Wow   this thing can haul , Yeah   this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned
Wow   this car can really burn rubber , It's a great feeling
How is your new car ? , Perfect  Couldn't be better
Wow   this new car is dynamite ! It is a shiny   beautiful car , My car is simply a daisy  It drives smoothly
You made a good choice , How are your wedding plans going ?
At ten o'clock on the morning of next Sunday  We have invited all our relatives to the wedding , It will be a large church one  Is your wedding dress ready ?
Thank you ! , Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
It will be expensive   but we think it will be worth , I think you made the right decision
How sweet , Yes  If she doesn't believe it   Christmas won't be so exciting to her
Oh   Mary   come in   please  I'm so happy to see you , Happy birthday   George  Many happy returns of the day  Here's a present for you
They're all waiting for you  Let's join them  I'm going to cut the cake soon , Let's go
I am fine  I am going swimming this afternoon  Are you coming with me ? , I am afraid I can ’ t this afternoon  I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons
Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? , I don't quite remember  Why did you ask that ?
I guess I was stunned for a moment   then I quickly ran away to get help , Did you call the police ?
I graduated from Songhua University , When did you graduate ?
Was it quite special ? , Not for the others   but for me  I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in  He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory   and that person would call me again several minutes later
Oh   your classmates took you in , Only then did I realize it was April Fools ' Day
I'd love to   but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time , Oh ! I'm sorry   but I wish you could stay
Happy Thanksgiving ! , You   too
Have a nice Thanksgiving ! , The same to you !
Oh   I'll probably just stay at home , Happy Valentine's Day !
Wonderful , We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival
Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ? , OK  The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan  On that day   people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river
It sounds so moving , What is your hobby ?
I am interested in science fiction , How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ?
You are deadly right , Any plans tonight ?
Take it easy  It is all over now  How was it going   anyway ? , I don ’ t know  I think I did well in the paper exams  I was prepared to answer a lot of questions   but they didn't ask those as I expected  To my surprise   the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me
That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful , YeahIt is the very latest in digital video cameras
Such as ? , They offer clearer and sharper images  Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses   a photo mode and fast-action mode
What does this mean ? , This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home   like your digital TV or your computer
What special effects ? , Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves
So everybody's getting video mail , Have you bought another handset
I have changed a case for it , Can a handset case be changed ?
There are two more   one is orange and the other is pink  I have bought them all , It's really going to be fresh all the time
I hope so  We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it , I think you can go to visit the museum  It's worth seeing  You can go to the square some other time
Why not send them short messages ? , Can short messages reach them ?
I use short messages quite a lot  If it's not too complicated I will send a short message   which can save much phone charge , I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call   and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year   didn't it ?
Mine  It's My Heart Will Go On   the theme song of Titanic  Isn't it of strong character ? , Are you able to compose music ?

Of course  It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year , People here always wear the best clothes they have  Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve
What's that ? , It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do  Many people resolve to quit smoking   lose weight   or stop nagging their wife   etc  However   it usually lasts only for a few days !
Thanks a lot , It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays
A Sony  It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart , What about the quality ?
I've got to be going now too , In that case   I'll be seeing you
Yes   the snow is often falling thick and fast here , Well   I think I like it  I appreciate the snow very much
There are so many places around  Take a look at the advertisement , Good afternoon   Mrs  Brown  I've come to see Mr  Brown
I'm sorry   but he's not in   he's gone out on business , Oh ! I just drop in on him for a chat
It's time to leave the office for the night  Firstly I log off my computer   then I set the electronic security system , That's pretty advanced
Yes   the car park is under constant video surveillance   so my car is quite safe  Please get in , Thank you  Where is your key ?
Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home  Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out , Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves
When I turn off my home alarm   the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level , I have to get home   but I don't need all of this fancy technology   I think I'll just walk
Please excuse me   won't you ? , Certainly  Come back soon

Okay ! What do you suggest ? , How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater
What's on ? , Let me see  um  Gone With the Wind  It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night
What time does it start ? , Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us   I think

Mr  Wilson   here's a present for you , Oh   you are so nice  What a lovely scarf
The Spring Festival is drawing close  By then we will have five days off  I am expecting it , Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ?
Christmas has more religious nature   while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday  On the New Year's Eve   we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner '  One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings  After that   the adults usually sit chatting   watching TV   or playing cards , What are the children doing ?
Perhaps it is like what people told you  At 24 hours midnight   the time when the New Year really comes   we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other   and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper   in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money , Who will get the money ?
That's great , Now let's get things ready
What's that   a new video game ? , Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do
Wow ! Anything else ? , This one comes with its own folding keyboard  It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program  I can use the stylus to write on the screen
When will the ceremony begin ? , The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock  After the ceremony   there's a reception  By the way   do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ?
It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding , How can I forget my old friend ?
Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country , Really ? He is so great
Yes   and I want to have a try , What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ?
Detached  You're literally detached from one planet   captured by another  Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y   it stays in view the whole time , There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality  Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?
I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair   that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on  But only time will tell , You had gone to the moon twice   orbited space around the Earth lots of times   and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have  How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait
No   not usually  Most people are married in a church   and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception  Sometimes   however   they hold the reception in a big room in the church , Where do they go ?
Why do you ask ? , The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite
Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding , Tell me something about the bridal bouquet  Isn't it the custom to throw it ?
I'm reading an interesting report on Mars , Oh   what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ?
The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything  And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation , Actually   we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time  Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ?
Well   I'm not really an expert in this area   but my understanding is that anything is possible  It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 45 billion years ago , But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans
But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness   food storage   and a series of physiological effects , Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ?
Sorry   sir  The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st , That's fine  I want 2 tickets
But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? , It's once in blue moon
I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert , Sure  How do you like your seats ?
I think they are too far from the stage  I want two in row 6 , That's fine  But you have to pay another $ 10
But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy  If galaxies are moving apart from each other   how can they collide ? , Well   the universe is a chaotic place   and the gravity from one galaxy   or from a group of galaxies   may disturb the motion of its near neighbors   causing them to collide  However   on average   when you compare two large enough chunks of space   the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other
Do you have anything to do after this ? , No   I don't
I know a very interesting place , Oh   do you ? Good
Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love , Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex !

I hear you are moving to Dalian , Yes  I found a very good job down here
Let's keep in touch , OK  I will write to you as soon as I get there

It's my heart ; it's made of what you like , Oh   I will have a sweet dream
Yes   I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office , ThxBye for now  Kisssssssssss
I think that   as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure   it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people   and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced , There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group  But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ?
I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information   like your home address   until after several dates  Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger , Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites   do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet
Yes   the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Matchcom and they're getting married this summer , How long have you been living in New York ?
They still live in Shanghai where I was born , Do you write or call them very much ?
Wow   what a great burd ! , She sure knows how to strut her stuff
Yeah   I noticed  She must be really loaded , No way  Her old man is rich  He buys her anything she wants
Well   that's my opinion , I admit that she is much prettier than Kate
Oh   hi   Jessica   are you going to see this movie too ? , I'd love to   the movies are smash hit
I'll say the movie's starting in the minute , I know  I wonder what's keeping him
What's he trying to pull anyway , I don't know  But this is definitely the last straw
Did you enjoy that new movie ? , That movie's just a lot of noise   same as Simon
What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's   he said he was coming , Kitty's ? He sure gets around   doesn't he ?
I think that's a bunch of nonsense  It seemed ok to me , I know  Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy
If you want I'll let him know if I run into him , Thanks anyway   but I'll do it   Rebecca  Let's get to class
You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones , You know what we will get ?
This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk  The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments   like fax   copier   a screen   printer and scanner   and it will be very convenient , Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment   I don ’ t need a desktop anymore  A laptop is enough
If the weather's fine , I am sure it will be  It's been good so far this weekend
But remember   be careful when you ride a bike  The traffic in Beijing can be dangerous , Hoo   I'm getting tired   Jeanine   been a long day

Let me help you with that  I don't want you to hurt your back , Where are you taking all this stuff ?
Yes   that's true   but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away , What's your name ?
I'm fine  Thank you , Where are you from   Sam ?
I'm a bank manager , Hello   Steven  Congratulations !
We're happy together now  We both think that we're a well-matched couple , That's very good  It's said that marriage is the Ab of love  But the words may not be right
What does it say ? , A lot of things  There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless  You really should read it

He isn't a man of good taste for clothes   is he ? , He is   but I didn't mean that  His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift   and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office
Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day , The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term  Do you find that interesting ?

Yes   but I couldn't help it  I was late getting off work for a start   and then I missed the bus  The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam  It was one thing after another , But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six   doesn't it ?

Call us as soon as you get home , Did you watch TV last night   Rose ?
Mars  Scientists say there might be water on it , If so   we may live there someday
Yes  Both have sent back pictures of the planet  And the latter did a better job , Sometimes I think television is too biased  None of them are completely objective
Look   you can still learn a lot from watching television   you just need to be smart when you're watching  Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not , The internet's a lot worse
Again   you need to think carefully  If you don't trust others online   have nothing to do with them , Who is your favorite NBA star ?
He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers   but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand , Maybe he is not good at rebounding ?

Oh   really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well , I'm glad you say so  You dance beautifully too  It's lucky that I got you as a partner
Disco is my favorite  I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings   and is a healthy exercise  But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing , Oh   well   the music has stopped  Thank you for the dance
That's a great idea  It's the best season for tourists in Florida  You can also get a good sun-tan there , But if the sunshine is too strong   it might damage the eyes and the skin
You said it , Would you like a cigarette ?
Well   it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more   you should stop doing it , I see  You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
But it's true  It's a nasty habit  I can't think why I ever started  Anyway   it's obviously got you in its grip ! , What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
How do you know ? , Because I've already proved it  Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up  I've done it hundreds of times !
How come ? , I don't know
Don't jump to conclusions  Look at the bright side   try to make another date again , I will  Thanks for your advice

In the kitchen   with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show , What does he do there ?
Certainly  Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong  His Chinese name is Cheng Long , Ha   I know Cheng Long a lot   he has made 40 films since 1976  And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee  But I'm not familiar with his English name
He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film   incredible stunts  By the way   can you count the breaks ? , Sure  His skull   his eyes   his nose   three times   his jaw   his shoul-der   is chest   two fingers   a knee  As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '
Look at this   A Brief Introduction of Hollywood , Hackneyed theme !
You are full of boasts  I can examine you by question and answer  What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? , Too easy questions  Listen carefully  Hollywood is the movie capital of the worldIt is located in southern California  Many films have been made there   and the kinds have changed often
Mm  What came after that ? , After all that violence   people needed to laugh   so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s   many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made  Then came musicals
The western films about America's cowboys   Indians and early settlers , Come on
Of course   no list of film would be complete without animated movies  These are especially popular among children , Now that you'recommending such enormous fees   producers   directors   movie-makers must see you in a completely different light
Well   if that's the case   I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have  I can only do what I know   and live how I've lived all my life   because I'm a fairly stubborn person , It seems to me that now you're famous  You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties
Yes  I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life  I love what I do and I love how I spend my time   which isn't in a public place , A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts  I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood   that you've watched and thought   ' Well   they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about  '
We actually met at a dance party  He fell for me , He must be all over you the first time he saw you
Well   he indeed likes me , But I think he can't hold a candle to you  I don't think he has ever popped the question
That is a heavy raining afternoon  I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain  It's getting dark , And then ?
Yeah , It's a romantic meeting  I can say that a hero saves a beauty
Pretty ! Say beautiful rather  Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? , I do not know what I could imagine   but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers
A magic love potion ? , Yes  If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep   he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up
So what am I going to do ? , Just come to our house and stay over  You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose   ' Good morning ! '
I went to Super Junior's concert last night  It was fantastic , Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now  I am also a big fan of theirs
The lyrics of the new song are beautiful   too  Can you sing ? , Sure  I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now
Herman   why are you so excited ? , I have met a beautiful girl
Can you describe the situation at that time ? , At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by   her tone is best   neither over-passionate   nor too cold
Did you watch the Premiership last night ? , Yes   I watched United play Chelsea  What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield  Well   it was not like a normal English League match
Which team do you back then ? , I'm a firm United supporter  I like their playing style  The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs   Like Riggs   Peckham and Gary Neville  They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking
Sure  I am free tomorrow  It sounds interesting to me  Can we buy the ticket online ? , I don't think so  I think we had better go there earlier   or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting
Yeah  We are lucky  Let's go buy the tickets first  We can have breakfast later  I am so hungry , Good idea
Sure   take your time  We have a whole day , It's on the 2nd floor  We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece
I wish it could be Germany  But it seems they are not in a very good conditions , No   they aren't  They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes  Just think   group A consists of Austria   China   and Saudi Arabia   all of which are minnows
I agree  Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders   they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate   well-timed passes , That's why I still have very high hopes for the team  Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage   the Germans will probably make it through to the finals
It's harmful  Not only for yourself but for others , What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?
That's rightBut I don't think there are better ways , How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ?
Yes   I'm afraid I am  My husband is a smoker too , Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?
I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen , Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ?
No   you must stay ! I swear it   and the oath shall be kept , I tell you I must go !
I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion , I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return
why not ? I love animals and I love nature , You can see many cows and horses there  lf you are brave enough   you can try horseback riding  it is fun
That is true  Some people go camping   some people pick fresh fruit   some people go boating and some people go grass skiing , I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm
Yes  we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake  Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? , Of course  I will
No problem  It is always worth trying something new once in your life time , I have a sweet tooth  I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals
Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people , why not ? I would like to buy some candies  Since there are so many people   I think they must have delicious candy
I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything , Me too  I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people
That is true  Speaking of cavities   I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now  Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home , You really can't live without candy
Maybe so  But a law banning cigarettes would do no good , NoYou can't suddenly make smoking illegal  But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters
To tell you the truth   the dog isn't my real reason for coming  I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend , Really ?
The tallest one , She is Miao Li  She's come here to see her brother
How do you think about her ? , She looks very beautiful  She is a nice girl
Great ! Thank you very much , You look a bit dull today  What's up ?
The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole , Yeah   it's true  What is she going to do ?
Thank you  I just hope she won't feel pressed , Do you know his sister ?
How old is she ? , Um  let me see now   is it 18 or 19   I can never remember  18  19 next birthday  Tthat's it
Pretty   is she ? , Yes  quite pretty
I guess I don't earn enough , No   I think it's how you budget your life   that's the problem
So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? , I don't just survive  I put money away as well  I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go   and I stick to my plan  If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises
Hey   Jeff   where's your stereo ? , I needed some money   so I hocked it last week
It sounds like you weren't expecting that , I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend  He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away
What colour is her hair ? , Oh   blonde   she's very blonde  quite short hair
Does she wear glasses ? , No  no  I think you're thinking of someone else
Ah  No   I can't place her , That one looks pretty big  Are you going to keep it ?
If it's within the legal limit   I prefer to keep it , My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another  She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay
It is different now  The world is becoming colorful  Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry  We all want to wait for the right moment , What time is the right moment ?
They sure are  They are practically jumping in the boat , Is that so ? Well   what kind of bait are you using ?
What kind of live bait are you using ? Worms or minnows ? , We're using worms
That's too bad  Why don't you try using lures instead ? , I would   but I don't have any in my tackle box
We went out in our boat  I have a favorite fishing hole out there , SweetCan you tell me where it is ?
Sure   I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time , Thanks  I think I'll go check that out now
He appeals to the fans thanks to two things , You mean he plays well ? Yeah   he often scores by free kicks in crucial games  But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks
Yes   his face looks are manly   with a straight nose and infinite eyes  As a man of medium height in the West   he keeps a powerful but elegant figure   looking neither lanky nor stout , And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent
Fine   honey  Rome couldn't be built with in one day , OK   I'll find the time to relax soon
YesIt ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day , It's like information overload   not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines
I like to read Fortune , Good  Fortune is usually ahead of the curveAnd Business Week is very solid   too
But sometimes when a flimsy report   or even a rumor gets on television   there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect , You are right about that
What kinds of books do you like to read ? , Literature and economy
What do you do in your spare time ? , I like to play golf   play badminton or crack jokes

Would you like to stretch your legs ? , Sure
It's a fifteen-minute intermission , The seats are excellent  We're right in the center
Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? , In the United States   yes  But back in China   I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents
That's great  Well   we'd better get back to our seats  It's about to start , Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ?
Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap musicYou can dance to heavy metal , Hey   you can dance to rap music !

I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football   and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it  ' , That's right  His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up  He has fan clubs across the world   from America to Russia   from England to Taiwan   from Norway to Australia

Okay   show me your card hand  Here's mine  I have three Kings and a pair of Aces , How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand   I loseThis is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw
That   My Heart Will Go On  It warms my heart  you know   JanetJackson   Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different , Janet Jackson is more pop musicShania sings country music  Celine just seems to hit all the right notes

I guess it could happen , Hey   if you're not busy this weekend   would you like to go see a movie ?
You mean the one starring John Travolta ? , Yeah   that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding
Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie , I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller
Okay  But you have to admit that it was an exciting story   especially with that surprise ending , You should read the book  The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end
I know you are a good dancer  What dances do you like ? , I like the old styles of dance  Such as fox-trot   waltz   rumba   tango and so on  They're all graceful
I think so   because most young people like modern dances   such as rock and roll , Oh   sorry  I don't like them  Why not ask Lily  She likes modern dance
And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics   right ? , Yes   in all these four sports  the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way  They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving
Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? , It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events   middle or long distance races   relays   hurdles   barriers   and marathon
Very interesting ! , What do you suggest then ?
I'm glad you like itThe band is called " Four and One "  They are especially good at playing rock and roll , That's great ! I love to dance to fast music
OK  Let's disco , Now the band is playing a slow dance
All right  Let me get you something to drink , May I invite you for a dance ?
Me   what brought that on ? , There's a story about breakdancing in the paper
Like disco ? , Well   breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance
So  disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to itAnd breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether , You are witty
Well   then   may I invite you for the first dance ? , My pleasure  But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer   and I suppose you dance often
I'm glad you say so   you dance beautifully too  It's lucky that I got a partner , Thank you for your complimentsIt ' s just that you are a good leader  Do you like the fox-trot and tango ?
Oh   well   the music has stopped  Thank you for the dance , My pleasure  Let's go and have a drink
It's hard to say  Perhaps swimming is my favorite  I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity  In the scorching summer days   there's nothing like a cool swim  Currently   I go to the pool twice every week , Is the entrance charge expensive ?
You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it  It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort  This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging  Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest   which translates into inspirations  Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me  Sometimes   I even come up with a verse or two , You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone
Shall I light the stove ? , That's a good idea
Which season do you like best ? , I like spring  The days are long and the night are short  The flowers are in bloomWe go on picnics
I've heard the weather here is ideal   just like spring most of the year , That's correct  We have four seasons of spring
Yes   I can see  The summer heat is over   and the winter cold is still far away , What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ?
No   it isn't  But sometimes it snows a lot in winter , Does it rain a lot in summer there ?
I feel it's rather dry here , That's true  Many people from the south don't like the weather here
I seeso this is your hometown ? , I really like the record you lent me the other day
Not at all , I'm most grateful  Everyone in our class enjoyed it
I'd better be going , So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ?
Thank you for a wonderful meal , I'm glad you enjoyed it
Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter   it can be said as delicate and agile  To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically   adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it , Small and exquisite in size   easy to operate   foldable and easy to carry are its charms
I'm not sure  I promised to help my sister move Saturday , How about Sunday   then ? We could start in the morning
OK  I'll talk to you later , I'm afraid I've got to go  I have another appointment at five
Thank you  Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow  I'll have the pictures ready by then , I will
I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye , Yes   goodbye and keep in touch
Oh   really ? Is it a good way ? , Yes   very good
Yes   if we do business through other ways   it will cost a lot of time , Also it has low cost   and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet   which is very cheap
You mean there may be credit problems ? , Yes   but if you choose some good B2B websites   such problems can be avoided
Thanks  Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future , How do you shoot pool ?
You hit the white ball with your cue  The white ball hits the colored balls  And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets , How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ?
The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets , Let's go and try now !
I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet , Sure  I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores
Is the service charged ? , No  it's free
That's a good idea  I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack  The old one is hanging on by a thread ! , That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend
One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores , Can you tell me how it is done ?
I'm better now  Want to play again ? , I'll let you break the balls this time
You are crazy  Gambling is against my principles , What are you doing for Christmas this year ?
Who can't make it in your family ? , My sisterShe is going to her in-law's house this year
I want some computer games also  I gave my parents a really long Christmas list , I hope that I get what I asked for
Our family is a little different  We go to church on Christmas Eve instead , ( Before Christmas Party ) Are you ready for the Christmas party tonight
Great ! Uh   remember that there's a gift exchange   too  We all have to bring a gift , I've already got mine
Wow ! It's just what I wanted ! , Hey ! Why don't I have any presents !
Let's put it over there , Let's go to work  We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening
There    we're about done , Let's switch the lights on
We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow  Feel like coming along ? , Sure  I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race
These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground  He plays football   rides horses   drives racing cars   and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer  The funny thing about it is that   no matter what he plays   he always wins first place  I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life , Don't worry  He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it  My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day  He's really absorbed by the discussions
Hey   Tom  You look tired  Are you all right ? , I didn't sleep much last night
Don't you like games , I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends
I'm afraid not  To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information , Yes
What can I get you ? , I'd love a gin and tonic
What would you like to drink ? , A glass of white wine would be fine   thank you
Would you care for a drink ? , Just a club soda for me   please
I got Jacob  Any ideas what to get him ? , Booze !
Sure , Tell me then
A lot of things ! , Tell me in details
Why not ? , I need your help   Bob
Just relax  That's because you're new to chat  Let me take a look , A / S / L   IGP   H & K   and ZZZ  What the hell do they mean ?
Wrong  lt's not a place name   but a passionate act , Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me   and I thought she was in Hong Kong
Yeah   seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize , Did you listen to the weather forecast ?
No way ! , Yep   it should be here by tomorrow night
you really like brains that make you think   don't you ? , I guess you could say that  What kind of games do you like ?
Well   I like to play darts  Whenever I go to a bar   I usually play for a few hours , Did you play a lot of games when you were little ?
Not at all  I never really did   to be honest  What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? , Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games
How about mah-jong ? , It's a popular game with some people   but I've never played it
What did you do last night ? , I just stayed at home and watched TV
What were the results of the game ? , It ended in a tie
Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win  They are a much better team than Madrid , If Barcelona had played as they normally do   they should have won
That explains it , How many more games are left this season ?
In a few weeks  Are you planning on watching them ? , Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV
Ok   it's a date then ! , Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?
They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood , They're also one of the richest couples  They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want
I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films   but I don't think he won anything , Tom Cruise may be handsome   but I think he's a bit crazy   don't you ?
People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated , I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you
Being famous   I can do without   but I wouldn't mind being rich , What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
If he didn't have any drug problems   he would have won , What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
They are  The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards , That's so disappointing  I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs
I agree  Hopefully with the new regulations   fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs , Let's hope so
How many planets are there in the solar system ? , That's easy  Everyone knows that there are nine
I'm dead serious  They've decided that it's too small to be a planet   but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore , That sounds crazy  But they can't just change their mind about things like that
We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos , Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ?
I hope not  I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth , You're so old-fashioned  That's what people used to think about people from another country !
Today is December 23 2002 , Oh   the day after tomorrow is Christmas
I don't think so , How about going to a concert ?
Oh   I've been fine   but I'm having some trouble with my son , Tell me all about it
Well   he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band  And one night last weekend   he came home really late   way past his curfew , Really ? What happened ?
I haven't yet  I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through , You may be right   but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life
Hey   what's up ? , Oh   nothing
You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! , I admit it  I'm a wuss  I just can't do it in person
You've dated a lot  What's so different about Diana ? , Well   for one thing   she's gorgeous  She's so upbeat and sweet  Who doesn't like her ? Oh   I don't know  All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together  But   what if I'm wrong  Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way  Oh  forget it  This was a bad idea
I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana  She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night , You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything
Have a great time tomorrow night , Thanks  I plan on it
Hi   Mary  This is Tom , Oh   hi   Tom  How've you been ?
Well   uh  why not dine out together and go to the movies ? , Sounds like a good idea
Does your girl friend like swimming ? , Yes   she does  She is good at backstroke and free style
Really ? Then just ask her to follow me , I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming   aren't you ?
To tell you the truth   I have never thought of being a swimmer  I swim just for fun , That's good
I think you're being a little critical  The actor in the lead role is fantastic  I suppose the chorus could be a bit better   though , Do you know anyone in the play ?
That's only part of it  I absolutely adore this director  Every play he works on turns out great , So you've seen other plays that he's directed ?
I've never had a part in a play before   but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school , What did you do ?
Why not ? , I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat
Cool down   man  Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic  But life isn't really all that  You should take the initiative and make some changes first , What should I do then ?
Well   such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing  I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological  Bicycling home after work can help release your stress  Life in the offices is miserable  You just sit there in a daze   gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents  Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road  Just think   you are flashing past the poles with your own energy  How great ! , Could you come and spend the weekend with us ?
Maybe some other time , Good morning   Jerry  How's everything ?
Well   as a matter of fact   I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas , Merry Christmas !
We're having some friends overWhat are you doing ? , Oh  I'm just going to take it easy
Do you have any plans ? , Well   my family's away and I can't afford to do muchWhat about you ?
Yes   of course  It was nice to see you , It was nice to see you   too  And please give my regards to MrsRobbins
Fine   just fine  And you ? , Not bad  It really is great to see you again  W here have you been ?
Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come   but I'm not sure right now  I'll try to make itThank you for your invitation , Do you like swimming ?
I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits  I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits   and enable people to be fearless of the hardships   dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch , Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ?
Fine   they are colorful and tasty , Did you enjoy your dinner ?
No   thanks  I'm full , Another piece of meat pie ?
Ice cream   please , Congratulations on the new house !
I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it ! , What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ?
Romantic ? I can't remember what that word means , Well   you have three kids   so you knew what it meant once upon a time !
Not much , Do you want to go see a movie ?
Candlelight in the Window , Should we go see it ?
No  I heard that's really boring , Why don't we go to a concert instead ?
Thanks   I'm enough , At least one for your trip
Thanks ! These are beautiful  You shouldn't have ! , Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us
No  Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well , There are 10 frames in a bowling game  Each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame
Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this , Hey   slow down  I'll tell you more while playing
I don't think it was the problem with your hands   you did several excellent spares  You have no problem with your hands , Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ?
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? , Yes   are you ?
It wasn't cold out this morning , Well   it's started raining since then  Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there !
That's a good idea  But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it , Ok  I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on  It's a bit chilly in here
Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse , I don't think we have anything to worry about  Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
Alright  I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you , I usually bowl with an eight ball  I like the control of a light ball  I can spin it more   so that the ball hooks
Well done  You got them all  You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score  I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well , Good start  You knocked eight pins down  But you are left with a 7 10 split  Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl   it is going to be impossible
I am 24 , What is your date of birth ?
I was born in Beijing in 1965 , You look so young
You're really sporty ! , I want to do everything I can
There are clubs for beginners  It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times , What kinds of clubs ?
Okay , This little wooden stick is called a tee
Okay , Pick up a wood and hold it like this   interlocking your fingers
Hey ! , Not too bad  The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible
My native place is Shanghai   which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city , So are you a local ?
How about going to the theatre ? , I don't like going to the theatre
I like painting   sailing   watching football and talking to you , I like talking to you   too
Where did you go yesterday ? , I went to play tennis in the public park
I seldom play tennis  I prefer football and basketball , But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together
Yes   I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday , Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
China , What was the score ?
Do you like traveling ? , Yes   I've just come back from Scotland
How did you like it ? , It's fantastic
And do you have friends there ? , Yes   a lot of friends
So   is L  A  all it's cracked up to be ? , Well   the stereotype in the movies is that L  A  is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people  I guess   in the back of my mind   that's what I expected
You're right  Life isn't always like the movies , I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend  Did you enjoy it ?
Of course there is  The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration , Could you move smoothly ?
I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was , Poor girl !
I suppose skiing is easy for you , No   quite the opposite  I thought I'd never stop falling down  Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better
That sounds great , Oh   yes  The ski slopes are well lit  It's really nice to ski at night  Why don't you learn to ski ?
Hi   Monica   how is everything going ? , Everything goes well   but I am thinking about quitting my current job
That is important  Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application , Certainly   it is very nice talking with you  But I really have to go now  Catch you later
I get antsy not because you praise a guy   but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him , How come you think of him that way ?
Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? , Nothing smells a rat  I told you that he's an all-right guy
Yes   I am  What's up ? , Then would you please go to a dance party with me ?
But I am told that you dance wonderfully well , Thanks for flattering me  I think you dance a lot   right ?
It's hard to say   but I do love the foxtrot and waltz , How about rock'n'roll ?
Oh   it's really beautiful   but I just can't do it well , Don't be so modest  I'm sure you can do it very well  Then I'll meet you at six  Is that at all right ?
Lisa   would you like to go to the library with me ? , OK  Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ?
The weather is really nice today  Let's walk , The weather is good now   but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon
Wow   it's already 10:00 AM  He must have been up late last night , Yeah   he didn't come home until 12:00 AM
How do we get to the library from here ? , It's straight down this road on the left   next to the museum  It takes about 10 minutes
Really ? Where did you go ? , We went to Europe
Did you go to Berlin ? , No   We didn't go there  I'd like to go there next time
I went there last year  If you want   I can give you some information I have about the city , Thanks
And do you really love her ? , I think I do  I don't think I can be happier with another girl
But I'm already in a lot of trouble with my boss , Anything you say or do might make it worse  Just try to ride out the storm for a while
But she always harps on me , Just tell her off
Oh   never mind  I am just going to do the laundry today , I want to apologize  Is there anything can do for you ?
It's 8 sharp by my watch , Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go
And the date   please , The 5th
They say we're going to get some rain later , Oh   let's just hope it stays warm
I must be off now  I'm pressed for time , See you
I know little of her  I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent  Of course   she ’ s diligent   too , That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on
I need to cancel that  We have had a last minute change of plans , I see  Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ?
Thank you very much , That's all right  I hope we can help you at some other time  Good-bye
To be honest   I'm really fed up with work at the moment  I need a break ! , Are you doing anything this weekend ?
Yes   that's my only day off until Thursday , Ok   well   my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday  We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere   so you could still sleep in  Do you want to come with us ?
What should I bring with me ? , We've got plenty of inflatables   but if you want to sit on a chair   you'll have to bring your own sunlounger

Congratulations ! I had no idea , Thank you  So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can   you'll have a good time , Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
I'm sure he'll love the idea  Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! , When will our party be held ?
Yes   I have , When ?
Yes   he will , That's fine
Yes   traffic wasn't much today   so I made it to the office earlier , I see  How long does it take you to reach the office every day ?
No  I take public transportation  It's safer , You are right ! But I get up a little late  That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle
Certainly , When will you be free ?
Yes   I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 , Are you free this Saturday evening ?
I'd like to   where ? , At our club
I'll go in time   thank you , I'm so pleased that you can go
I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar  Is it in good condition ? , Yt looks good on the outside   but the inside is a different story  It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again
When's the last time you had it serviced ? , It must have been a few years ago now
What else is wrong with it ? , The heating controls don't work anymore   so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer !
Why don't you get it all fixed ? , It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
I had to look after my son at home , What's wrong with him ?

Everything seems to be getting worse  I don't know what to do with it , Things are tough all over  You should never give up !
OK   OK  I ’ ll do my best , I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up
I have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends  One of my friends seems to be on good terms with Sue , Is he beating Mark ’ s time ?
Sort of yes , But he is not someone who can be led by the nose
Yes  Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? , Actually   why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour
Not really   but I liked the design   so I got it , Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better
Yes   my father gave it to me for my birthday  Do you like it ? , It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike  These are really expensive !
Well   my saddle is too low for me  Do you know how to change the height ? , That's easy  It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle
Hey   Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? , YesDo you like it ?

I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish  I'll show them to you next time I see you , Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ?
Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ? , I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland !
It would be good for both if they lived separately  My parents want to live apart from us , What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ?
You need a child first   and that's your duty   too , I know that's what I must do
How are you ? , I'm good  How are you ?
Yes , Where are you from ?
Nice to meet you too , Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ?

Oh   you went to the wedding ? , No   he didn't tell me about it  Don't feel bad
It's Thursday   I think , Tomorrow is Friday  It's going to be the weekend
I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else , They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness
That ’ s an exception  But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me , I cannot see eye to eye with you here  You see   I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me  I mean   they smile for no reason at all
I don't know  Who ? , Avril Lavigen !
So you're a big fan   eh ? , Not really  But I like some of her songs  She's actually very talented  She's a song writer and fashion designer   too
What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? , She looked sweeter than her pictures
Crazy ! , So you are green with envy at your neighbor ?
I know what you mean  I ’ m not only after bucks  There ’ s something more in life , Some people are easily flimflammed
Sure  Many people   including men and women   and be easily ripped off , Charlotte   have you had your supper ?
I ’ m down in spirits , What's up ?
I think I'm too clumsy  I can do nothing well , You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done
We are just going round the corner for a drink  Won't you join us ? , Well   I'd like to   but I am not sure I have time
Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ? , I'd love to
How about Thursday ? , Yes   Thursday would be fine  What time shall I come ?
See you on Thursday   then , I have a suggestion  Why don't we go to a ETV and sing ?
I don't know  I never went to one , Never ? Really ? I'm surprised
OK   let's go , May I have an appointment with you tonight ?
7:00 in my staying hotel , OK   I am going to the hotel to pick you up  See you tomorrow night
Really ? I hope to meet him soon , Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?

It's about 5 degrees centigrade , What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?

Thanks   I will , John   you look pale  What happened ?
Will   I'm under a lot of pressure  My manager is very pushy  He assigned me two projects  Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them , Is there anything I can do for you ?
Oh   buddy   you are so kind  Thank you ! , Not at all !
I don't know what to say  I'd like to replace it , No  It's out of the question
Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? , About ten years so far  I started learning when I was in middle school
Well   I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts   though , Of course it does  Everybody has his own hobby
Do you drink green tea   then ? , Very seldom   because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health
Not only can it appease one's thirst   but it can also refresh one when tired , That's true   but it must not be allowed to stand long
Brian   do you know how to speak English ? , Yes
You speak really well , Thank you
Is your wife with you ? , Yes   she just got here yesterday

Just find the answer through Internet , Yes   let's do it now
You look so upset  What's going on ? , I lost the table tennis game yesterday
Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game , My opponent bowled me with the very first ball  I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis
I understand , Well   I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater  Why don't you join me ?
I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day  But how about my paper ? , Just take it easy  Come on with me
Yes   I agree  The air here is much more polluted than in my country , That's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry
The problem is now on a truly global scale  I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it , I think you're right  An international response to this problem is needed
Not interested ? , Not really   to be honest  Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me
Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? , What   it keeps coming back ?
They're also known as bell-bottoms  They are a type of trousers , It's too complicated  I'll just stick to the plain clothes
Yes   I also felt that  I'm always busy   and have no time for rest  I don ’ t know how to make use of time , Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next   and follow it
Yeah   time is money  We really need to make good use of it , You know   smoking does do harm to your health
I've tried to give up smoking several times   but it's no good  Smoking relaxes me , Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually
No   I only know four great beauties of China , There were some famous ugly women in history
Then who were they ? , Mo Mu   Thong Lichen   Meng Gang and Ran Nv  They were well respected

I'm not , Step up onto the rail  Hold on  Keep your eyes closed  Trust me ?
I'm fling   Jack  ( singing ) Come   Josephine   in my flying machine  Up she goes   and up she goes , Do you like tea ?
My favourite is Jasmine tea  I like its aroma , Yeah   but scented tea is now in fashion
Please count on my love , I will
Thank you  I know I've nothing to offer you   but I'll never give you reason to cry , I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie
I don't know whether we are in a dream , Aha   Aha
It's different in my case  I work in the office   so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun , It might be good to you  But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you  You might end up with skin cancer
How many can we choose ? , The aquamedic pool is included  You can choose three
That was heaven ! , The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you
Well   whatever it does   I feel transformed ! , Hey   Joshua ! Is Anny coming with us ?
Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Aha   someone has a crush on Anny   doesn't he ? , Who has a crush ?
You've got to let her know  Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! , Happy anniversary   sweetheart !
Well   it's a special day  They say if you survive the first year   the rest is smooth sailing , That's good to know  Oh   listen ! The band's playing our song
Flowers for my favorite girl , How did you know that I love red roses ?
Fine   what do you call this ? , Foxtrot  Oh  you're a good dancer
Rose   the weekend is coming  Let's discuss what we will do , What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ?
Let me see  We can visit the country  We haven't done that for such a long time , Good idea  I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby  We'll go to the zoo and the park another time  After all   we can put that off
You   too  Where did you get your new hat ? , From the Crown's  Oh   what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ?
He'll come out with surprises  Just wait and see  Look at that woman   with the white chiffon ! , She's chic   isn't she ?
Yes  She dressed with an individual flair  I rather envy her , Most women follow fashion like sheepThey don't know any better than imitate
So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar , You know those upstarts  They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon
Oh   my shoes pinch me  Let's find a seat and sit a while , At the Beijing Olympics   all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals  A clean sweep again !
In the first place   I think the whole nation is just fond of the game  It is well grounded with the mass  With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong   we can always spot a handful of potential world champions , So   the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership
They are subject to hard training  And you know what   for a player on the national team   personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions  They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other , Oh   dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights !
Yes   she is my favorite girl  I've decided to go steady with her , Are you sure she is the right girl ?
She is the mature   stable   feminine type  I hope one day I can marry her , Oh   that's great  You're serious this time
Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy , Sure  Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky
I don't think so  Let's walk by the stream  I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map , OK  I have a good pair of hiking boots  It should not be a big problem
Well   it is a birch treeIt is not as old as you think , How do you know ?
I went shopping , Did you buy anything ?
I bought this coat  Do you like it ? , Yeah   I like it a lot  It's very pretty  Where did you buy it ?
No   it wasn't expensive  It was on sale for 20 dollars , That's cheap
Paul   what kind of music do you like to listen to ? , All kinds   but mostly Pop   rock and classical  Why ?

Oh   how long ? , Down to his shoulders  It's beautiful   like gold
Really ? , He's quite a patient teacher   too
I know I'm a blabbermouth   but what do you think she should do   John ? , Honey   we're in the museum now  We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life  We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso !
Are you serious   John ? , All I'm trying to say is that life is  like  er  this painting
Look   darling ! I can see a bench near that tree , No   you can't  The bench is wet   too
Yes   I can , What does the notice say ?
No   not this weekend  I have too much work to do , Where do your parents live ?
My mother died two years ago , Oh   I am sorry to hear that  Is your father still working ?
Yes   two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here , Do you have any brothers or sisters ?
Not as much as I'd like to  Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas , I finally went out to dinner with him last night
Where did you go ? , True   a sea food restaurant
Really ? , How wonderful it is to be in love ! It's love at first sight ! Oh  he's my Romeo !
Who were you talking to ? , Um — I was just thinking aloud
Oh   you have a crush on someone   don't you ? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes ! , You certainly do like teasing me   Mary  Well I'm in love with someone  The question is   how do I get his attention ?
He said he will get married by the end of this month , Big talk   I ’ d say  He does not have a girlfriend yet
Say it ! What is it ? , That I can't go on any longer without you
Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it , Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments
No   I shall faint , And I hope so  This is what you were meant for  Say you love me   say yes   say yes
Oh   yes  It's a great party  There are some people I don't know   though , Really ? Come on   I'll introduce them to you
I've been having a hard time sleeping lately , As far as I know   insomnia is usually caused by stress  Are you stressed at all ?
You're probably right  I just wish it were that simple  How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? , Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress
You ’ re right  I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class , Besides   it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga  In fact   I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this   bend over and breath in deeply
Hello   Tom ! , Hello   Steven !
I'm just a little tired , Why ?
Pretty fine   thanks , Where are you going now ?
See you , Welcome back ! How was your vacation ?
Because it's off-season   we got a really good package deal to Paris   so we went there , I've always wanted to go to Paris  The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?
Oh   that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling  I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city , You don't look very happy in that picture
We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market  We had a few coffees   watched a movie   and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel , My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing  Did you go to the Louvre ?
How is your business on the Internet   Steven ? , Don't mention it  I lost a bunch of money on it this year  I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy
Yes   I agree with you  I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon , It's a good idea  But please be careful when you invest this time
OK  My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now  I am leaving , All right  Let's chat next time  Bye-bye
Yes   he was 29 then , He looked his age
From his looks   I'd say he's a man of character , Yes   my sister loves his personality
You are invited to my wedding , Thank you  I'll certainly be there
I used to swim a lot   but now I'm taking gym classes , Oh   that's fantastic !
Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us , Maybe   the whirligig of time   who knows ?
That's right  And his wife is a baby doll   too  She used to have many followers , Were you one of them ?
Oh   hi   Lee  You look great , Thanks  You too
Not too bad , Hi ! My name is Mike
Where are you from ? , I'm from Shanghai  And you ?
I'm moblogging ! , Moblogging ? what does that mean ?
Yes   you're right  I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move  It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me , How can you do that ?
Then I'll shoot some pictures   re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog , I see  Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you

What's the tattoo on her foot like ? , It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one
What's her personality like ? , She's a lot like me
How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod , Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face   but Tom does not
Not yet   Grandma   What's the matter ? , I want you to have a walk with me
I do wish I could afford one , You can get a loan from the bank  You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases
Well   I'm not sure  Maybe it means we can buy something through the Internet , That's right
Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet , Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me
That's true  I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net  Customers   in turn   can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered , Yeah  It'll be a shoppers heaven  That's the use of net in E-commerce
I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home   so you wouldn't have seen me  Recently   I've been obsessed with horror films , Oh   how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary
But it's really exciting , Maybe   but I would rather watch romance   science fiction   crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture  I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one
I think you should have a try someday  Maybe you'll change your mind , Maybe  After all   I am grown up now
Yes  It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics , I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market

Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall  Have you been there ? , Yes  I buy a lot of stuff from there  It's a good shop   isn't it ?
Graham   why are you always on the phone with Jane ? , Because we are partners in our science lab  Why are you so jealous ?

No I'm afraid not  I'm meeting Ruth then  How about the fourteenth in the morning ? , I'm sorry  I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then
Yes   I think I am  Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant , Good idea ! Is two o'clock okay ?
Fortunately   there is no person died , That's great  It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake
Well   China is located on the Eurasia plate   where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other , Oh   China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history
Right  But people at that time only know two words   " save " and " assistance "   they will never don't lift a finger  Life is the most important compared with anything else , That's the point  Love among human beings is not limited by geography
That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure , Absolutely  She's a teacher of aerobics
Late night ? , Yeah   I got home around two
Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? , I don't know
I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it , Can I use your laptop for a while ?

OK   Mum  I'll invite my friends home , How about a movie on Sunday   Mum ?
That sounds fine , Not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock  I can't believe it !
Actually   this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' , Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !
Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? , Yeah   it's a must  Otherwise   I may miss important phone calls and text messages
Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information , Are you a blogger ?
I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides , What do you usually write about ?
It's random  If there happen to be a lot of things going on   I may add several new entries in a week   and if I've got nothing to share   I may leave my blog untouched for weeks , Got it  Are you still updating your blog ?
Hello   Zhang lin ! Fancy meeting you here ! , Hi   Lin Tao  I have't seen you for some time
Pretty good   thanks  I'm going to see my uncle , Good bye then   and keep in touch
No   we're not  We've been drifting apart for a while , But you two used to do everything together  I thought you really enjoyed each other's company
I could   but all they ever talk about is work   so I always end up feeling left out , Maybe you should invite her over for dinner   so it's just the two of you
You're right  She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge  But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore , She's probably just excited about her new job  You should give her some time  It would be a shame to lose such a good friend
I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways , How did you spend the weekend ?
It was great  The director took a lot of care while framing  They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director  Also I like the actors   some really great new young actors , Oh   yeah ? What's it about ?
The ending is a bit of a surprise  I don't want to ruin it for you , Oh   I like movies with surprise endings   although   sometimes they can be frustrating  Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend
Yeah   he did  But he only won it by a hair's breadth , But anyway   he won at last
How come ? , Because General   his dog   got sick
I don't know  Maybe a pair of new shoes , Why don't you ask them to buy you a PC ? You will soon use it at college
I don't know   what's wrong ? , I feel he is as cold as charity to me
Yes   it's really a surprise  How are you ? , Fine  How is Jim ?

YesLet ' s hold a birthday party for him   shall we ? , Good idea ! Let's make ready   then
Are you close ? , Yes  He's one of my best friends  Our friendship formed at college  Why did you ask that ?
Yes   Steven  You always know what I want , Don ’ t worry  I will call Hanson   and ask him to help you
Thank you  You're very kind , Julia   are you free tonight ?
Are you asking me for a date ? , Yes
Let's go to the coffee shop then  It's quiet there , What time should we meet ?
MrMartin   we're on arrival , It's nice of you to see my off at the airport  Thank you very much
It's my pleasure  We hope you'll visit Beijing again , Certainly  I'll be glad to
Bye bye ! Have a pleasant journey ! , Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?
That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions  Do you want to go there ? , I'm not really in the mood for Italian   actually  I was thinking of something a bit spicy
You're right  Most of their dishes have sweet sauces  We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us , The Taj ? They're a bit expensive   but they do serve large portions of very hot food
They'll still charge us a corkage fee , That's right  It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway
No   I'll pay  It's my turn anyway  You paid last time , I won't argue with that ! Let's go !
How about going to the suburbs ? , Sounds good
Happy Mother's Day to you   Mum ! , Oh   thank youYou are so sweet !
Yeah   I'm going to the Temple Fair with my family , How nice ! Have fun !
Linda   thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner  I really enjoyed it , Thank you for coming  I'm glad you liked it
Oh   how was it ? , Good  I wish I could have another vacation
How come ? , I had to visit all my relatives
Oh   you shouldn't  But thank you very much , You don't look too well  Maybe you should take the day off from work
Not really  After a 12 - hour flight   I've got jetlag   and on top of that   I think I've also got the flu , Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now
Ok  I'll stay home this morning and rest   but if I feel better in the afternoon   I'm going to the meeting , Zach   what's that on your arm ?
Just cats   but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks , I completely forgot about your cat allergy  I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago  Oh no  we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine  Let's go
Whatever you say  I just want to get to my meeting ! , Which season do you like best ?
Have you heard about Michael's new home ? It's in one of the poshest areas in this area , Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ?
That's the one , His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford  The surrounding area is really peaceful   and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient  How can he afford that place ?
No one in the family expected to get a dime from him  It was quite a surprise , What a lucky man
He wanted to live right on a bus line   but he doesn't  so   if he wants to take a bus anywhere   he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop , The poor thing  It must be difficult being him
Um   very nice  It's warm in spring and cool in autumn , Is it hot in summer ?
You can never do that , Why ?
Yeah  They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity , I was fooled once  A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling  So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation  But later I learned that she had lied to me
Sometimes you look like brains   and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll , I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one
Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open  And just breathe that fresh air   you can almost taste its freshness , You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain
No wonder people say , Quick ! Pass me your binoculars  Look at that bird  I've never seen one of those before  It's indigenous to Guiling   and an endangered species too  This is lucky !
I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way  I need your understanding , I know   I know  But you always bat around without doing things useful
What a beautiful view , It sure is  The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece  No man could ever make anything like this
No  Thank you  It looks a bit too dangerous for me , There is a beautiful state park here  I can see why so many people come out here to camp
That's true , Please fill out the form
How many people are there in your family ? , My immediate family is quite small  It ’ s just my older step-brother   my mom   my step-dad and me  how about you ?
We ’ re identical  I mean   we look exactly the same   but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else , Interesting  It must be great having a twin sister  Are you best friends   too ?
What about your step-brother ’ s mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? , No   she also died when my step-brother was little  My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends  They ended up getting married a few years later
My husband and I have thought about it   but we ’ Ve decided not to have any  They are just too expensive  Besides   with all the news about global warming on the news lately   who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future  What about you ? , Well   I ’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children  Growing up with only one brother   I always felt a bit lonely  What do you think about families with only one child ?
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7  you know   I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home  What do you think of the one-child policy in China ? , If China didn ’ t have such a policy   can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
I don ’ t know what other people think   but I   for one   envy only children ! , How is everything going with your girlfriend ?
It was a few things  The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary   but she stood me up ! , Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ?
I wanted to   but I knew that if I spoke to her   I'd just blow up at her   so I decided to just go home  I called her later that night   but she didn't answer the phone , I can ’ t believe she would do that to you  It ’ s so dishonest---and rude !
I guess so  It would be nice to know why she did this though , I know  It ’ s always nice to have some closure   but I don ’ t think you ’ ll have a problem finding another girlfriend
Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? , Yes   but I am out of food and milk
I have been using the store across town for years , I hear they have very nice stuff
I will sometime  Thanks for the advice , How was your holiday to Cyprus ?
How did you know ? , You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love  Who is he ? How did you meet ?
Not really  I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance   but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me  I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose   so I went , And ?
Luckily   his company has a position available here   so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated , It sounds like he is madly in love with you  Are you ready for such a serious relationship ?
Not well  I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately , But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ?
I know you are   you are my girlfriend  I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes , I know what you mean  I find it difficult to make new friends   too  It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young   is it ?
That ’ s a good idea , What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ?
That ’ s a possibility  Thanks ! , What was your wedding ceremony like   Abigail ?
Well   since my husband and I are from two different countries   and we live in a third country   we decided to have one in each country  It wasn't actually that expensive , Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown   so that was great  Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions   but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family , That makes sense  Did you go on a honeymoon ?
Not at all   but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either   so it suited us perfectly ! , What do you think of the coming match ?
What are you doing now   Steven ? , I am reading a book about money management
No   you are wrong  Money can't buy happiness and health  I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money  In other words   I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life , Oh   I see  But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go  " I think it will be better if you have more money
No thanks , You like movies ?
Really it depends on my mood  When I am sad or depressed   I like comedies  If I'm feeling good   I'll watch almost anything , I see  I generally like movies to help calm me down  I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it
Yeah   many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties  They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time , I'm totally with you on that
Buying a house can be expensive   but there are ways to find cheaper houses , Like what ?
Sure   my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way  They ’ re pretty satisfied with it , Is the house pretty run-down
It was about 75 years old  There were a few repairs that needed doing   but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time , Is it in a good location ?
Yeah   it's very easy  But it's above Nick's head , Why do you say so ?
No  what's it like ? , It's got its own library   theatre   swimming pool   and a guest house  The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control  It's also located near the sea   so he can park his boats next to his house  It's absolutely amazing !
What's your dreamhole like then ? , My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England
Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ? , No   that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !
This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty , So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it
I like your sweater  It suits you very well , Thank you for saying that  It's a present from my girlfriend

Very well   thank you , Your tie is handsome
Nothing special , How about having dinner with me ?
No problem  However   maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner , Don ’ t worry  I will arrange everything

Don't mention it  You know   we ’ re old friends , Anyway   I owe you one  Are you free tonight ?
That ’ s great  I'd love to , Hi   Bob  Can I have the book back I lent to you last month ?
Could you lend your bike to me for several days ? , How long would you like to keep it ?
Hi   Zhengjun   what make you so happy , You know what   I've just got a new job with a computer company
I want to travel , Where would you like to go ?
I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before   so I ’ ll choose Dalian  I've heard that the environment there is very good , Yes   that's a good place to spend a holiday  Last year I went there  It's really
Ok   you name the day , How about the second of March ?
Good  Where shall we meet ? , Jack   I hear you got promotedIs that true ?
Thank you for saying that , Hi ! Tom  Want to go to play bowling tonight ?
Fine   see you then , Now   you are to board the planeWe ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China
Will you be kind to say " Thank you " to MrZhang and other friends for me ? , I'd like to  I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of usWelcome to China again
Goodbye ! , I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job !
But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved   right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do , That ’ s true   but my supervisor is very dishonest  There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth  I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault   and there ’ s nothing I can do about that  My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth
Well   you can't have everything  Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job  When is your contract up on your apartment ? , Next month  So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year
If you lose your job   you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy  If you live frugally   you ’ ll save plenty of money , I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy  Maybe losing my job would be a good thing !
What are the good sights to see in Beijing ? , Well   I know you are interested in architecture   so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven   and the Great wall is a must too
Do you play table tennis ? , Not really   but I like watching
That must be very beautiful , Yes   it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies
Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me , Sure  I'd be very glad to be your tour guide
Much as I wish to but I really can ’ t  I've already booked the flight , I hope this won ’ t be our last meeting
I will miss you   too  You're really a good friend , It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow
I will , Goodbye and have a good flight

What's that ? , Well   I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning   and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic
Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset , Ok   I'll try that
Do you have any other plans this weekend ? , I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday
Steven   have you ever met Hanson ever since he went back to London ? , No   but we still stay in touch

No   not much  In fact   nothing ever really happens  That's the trouble , Hey  Let's trade places one weekend !
Oh   it's really a drag , Sorry to hear that  I think it's even better than On the Golden pond
I heard it has been finally settled under the rose , It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation
Dad   I lost mum's necklace  I'm afraid she will scold me , Don ’ t worry  I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one

Great minds think alike , How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !
We'd better prepare for the worst , I feel pity for the old man
It sure isHe has no one to turn to   very miserable indeed , He has to deliver letters every day
Oh   Really ? , I have been feeling sick for three days
You must be feeling terrible for Mary , Yes   she's been like this for two weeks

Well  I think IQ matters more  But it won't work without EQ , Why ? You seem pretty sure about it
That's why people's achievement varies greatly , That ' s true   but what if one comes across some difficulties  He must rely on his EQ to deal with them
Quite right  Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? , Just as Forrest ?

Pleased to meet you too   Ms Jenson , We should keep Frank at arm's length
And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided , Now I know why I split up with Mike  We found we were simply not good for each other
Ha-ha   so you believe in astrology ? , What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer   I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life  But according to astrology   Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-takingThey seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life
But as far as I remember   you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met , Exactly  But later on   he cares more about his career than love  Work seems to be the better all   and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me
Yes  The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth   and they have developed into a festival filled with food   performances and games now , Sounds interesting !

How is grandpa doing recently ? , Not good  The doctor told him not to smoke again   but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back !
The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day , Yeah   she has a lot of homework
Yeah   at least when we are children   we have not so much homework to do , Look   it's all water over the dam now  Let's leave it behind us
Only sometimes when I think about it   I feel very sad , It's normal  Time will change everything
I hear that John's leading a double wife , It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife
Yeah , Well   he is a hard case  Everyone would feel headache about him
But we cannot talk like elders , Of course not  Let's talk to him in a very friendly way
Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true , If he promised to help you   I'm sure he will help  He's a man of his word
Don't have some relation with him  You know   he is not a kind man , Yeah  Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior
Why are you going out with Andy ? , Because I like him
I did   but he gives me a runaround , If I were you   I would put the whole matter on the table

Hi   Craig ! How are you ? , Not so good  I have a terrible cold
And have you taken anything for it ? , No   I haven't

It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys , Yeah
You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun , A barrel of fun   of course  He often says that I'm a date bait
Why ? , Because everyone is trying to butter him up
Did he see the doctor ? , Yeah   but he refused to take the medicine
I hear your sister has had an accident   is it true ? , Yeah   it happened a week ago
Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? , I used to be an atheist  But in recent months   I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope
What did it say about you then ? , For example   the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I   as a Leo guy   was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink  And as it turned out   the reality matched this prediction well  Lasi night   I was treated to a dinner party by Mr  Lee
For fun  It serves as a shared topic to themWhile they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy '  they do not necessarily take them seriously  When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences   they delight in spreading the thrill with friends  But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions   they just grin   forget about them   and go on living as usual , Are you going to the party on Saturday ?
Really ? Well   what time does it start ? , It starts at 8
How do you know it's going to be so fun ? , This party is going to have a DJ   food   and drinks

Well then   I'll see you on Saturday  Thanks for asking me to go with you , Mr  Lee   I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ?
That sounds great  Is it casual ? , Actually   we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays
That sounds wonderful  Will there be anyone there that I know ? , Oh yes   everyone we are inviting is from our company
Pretty good  Mary   I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ? , I am free that night   and a party sounds good
I can do that  Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ? , I would really like to bring my friend Jake   if that would be OK
Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink , It's raining outside   Catherine   it's too badWhat ' s the weather like in your hometown ?

I'm so glad to meet you , How is everything going on ?
Really ? Thank you , It's nice and bright today   isn't it ?
That's a hard timeThe air is cold and damp   and the road is often icy , It's boring   right ?
PlentyWe never worry about lack of rainwater in our area , So you should bring an umbrella often
Yes   the weather sure is nice today , I love it when the weather is like thisWhy don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
Hey   this spot in the shade looks really comfortable , OkayHey   is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ?
Good afternoon ! , Good afternoon ! Sit down   pleaseHow are you ?

It will begin at 5:30 , I am afraid I can't be there on time
Well   how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? , It was funny
Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? , Sure   we wouldn't miss it for anything  After that   we took a short cut to the park  There was very little traffic   so we got there in less than an hour
So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday , Yes   you're right  And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back  My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday
Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? , I'm afraid not  Every coin has two sides  I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction
Oh   that's too bad   Where can you park around here ? , There is a square in front of us  We can park the car there
Do you often surf the Internet ? , Yeah  I do it once a week
Oh   I'll have a try , I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country
It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land  Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach , Is it just a bus ?
Hello   Jason   there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow  I plan to go to see it , Is it a horror movie ?
That's funny   I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside , Hey   how would you like to taste my fist ?
That is to say   you like all genres except for horror movies , Yeah  It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned
Really ? I haven't heard of it , Well then   this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together  I bet you'd love it

What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? , Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head  She doesn't like an apple-headed man   you know
I cannot dance   you know  I have't such a talent , Just for fun   not for showing  What do you worry about ?
It sounds that you have a high opinion of him , He is an all-right guy  I have no bone to pick with him
You cannot judge a person that way  I have a hunch that he is a sly dog , Depends on with whom  He may be doing things on the sly   but he is honest with me  I trust him
I know she is quite an article   but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss , She cannot get in Dutch with him  He is her boss   you know
Not yet  I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher  I am sure he can help , Let ’ s have a try
I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th , Are you going to have a birthday party ?
ThanksMiss Zhang , You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave
It's Ellie and her friends , Who's Ellie ?

Hi Mary   how's it going ? , Well   last night I had a big argument with Ann

You know she probably feels just as bad , Well   I think I was being a little selfish myself  I know they don't get to see each other very often
Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ? , Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday
So there are only five working days in a week ? , Right  What are you going to do tonight ?

I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us , Yes   look over there  That's the Empire State Building  My book says it's 102 stories tall
What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? , Quite a number  Actually every skyscraper has a history  A few blocks ahead we'll see StPatrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center  It's a landmark in the history of architecture
What are they all for ? , Most of them are office buildings   huge department stores   and hotels but some are just private homes  New York is one of the financial centers of the world  And there are lots of very expensive places
If I were him   I would give him a good talking-to  I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that , They promised us a sea view
Well   it can't be helped  We'll just have to put up with it , Hey Lucas   how was your trip to Paris ?
Yes   that was the first thing we did  We went all the way to the top  There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there , What else did you see ?
Yes   at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun  However   on the third day of travelling in the city   I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening , Yes  you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroadsometimes new food might disagree with you
You'll have to try for yourself some day , Could you tell me what university you want to go to   John ?
University ? Why ? You asked me last year , Oh   I forgetSorry

Certainly   perhaps , Hello   Pam
Yeah  I've invited a lot of friends besides you , Should I take my shoes off ?
They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves , That's great !
What about a factory tour ? , You mean visit a factory ?
I'm not sure   but as far as I know   most factory tours are free  They are sponsored by the company providing the tour , Really ? What do the companies do that for ?
Exactly , Do we need an appointment beforehand ?
Yeah , This is Alex  Remember ? This is Sean
Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? , That's my boyfriend Matt  Isn't he cute ?
It's a lovely day   isn't it ? , Yeah   and most excitingly   I met the girl living under me today  She's really nice
So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor   but what if you break up ? , I don't know  I am not really worried about that  I don't wanna lose before even starting  Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her
That's nice  Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage   eh ? , You bet  Now that you mentioned it   I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight
Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know , I have exactly the same feeling  This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me  He knows a lot about investments
Great  I hung out with Jo all day shopping   and the went out for dinner together , Sounds a good weekend  You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends
When Jo and I are together   we argue a lot   but that's also part of the fun  Besides   I know she will always be there for me when I need her   and she knows I'll be there for her , It seems you two bring out the best of one another
Thanks   I think so too , Hey   Mary   what's up ?
Well   I ddin't think so at first  But as we started talking   I found him extremely funny and witty  I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common  We like the same teams   music   and most amazingly   we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends , It seems you two are a good match  What qualities do you look for in a friend ?
I agree  You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person  Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need , Yeah   I know  A friend in need is a friend indeed  I don't need fair-weather friends either
The state of economy is starting to go up in our country , That ’ s just the short in the arm we need

She came over last weekend  She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out  I tried to smile and be polite   but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " , Well   I guess it might take some time to get used to
No   it's so much worse  And tonight they invited me out to dinner  I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off , Rough  Maybe you can do the most of the talking
I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love , Very romantic ?
Definitely not  The most important thing was we loved each other , Jessica is going back to Holland next week  I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift   but I still have no clue
I am not good at picking gifts  Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? , I don't think so  That way it would lose all the charm  I want it to be a surprise  I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last
A plant ? That's creative  I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you  But there is a problem  Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? , I hope so  I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase  I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border
Much better  My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me , Don ’ t be sad  Everything will be fine
What happened ? , My som was lost  I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping   but he ignored it

Well   to be frank   yes   I do , Oh   I ’ m sorry  But this isn ’ t a no-smoker   is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ?
There   on the window , Oh   sorry  I didn ’ t notice it  Sorry
Yes   I ’ m afraid I am  My husband is a smoker too , Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?
I had my first cigarette when I was 17 , Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ?
Well   it ’ s hard to say  I coughed a lot in the evening , You ’ d better give up smoking  It ’ s bad for your health
You know I often have to work far into the night  I need smoking to keep me awake , Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work
I don ’ t think so  I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking , Maybe so  But a law banning cigarettes will do no good
She told me that she's got tennis practice today , You're Mary   right ?
I see  Do you live in this neighborhood   too ? , My house is next door to yours
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss  What shall I do ? , I think you'd better apologize

And the people were so friendly ! , Yeah   we would have been lost without the help of the locals
I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day , If only we could eat there once more !
Hey   what's the time ? , Oh   my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off  We need to be at the airport now
Well   it's hard to say  I cough a lot in the evening , You'd better give up smoking  It's bad for your health
You know   I often have to work till late at night  I need something to keep me awake , Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work
Oh   hi Lucas   come on in  I'm Barbara  Nice to meet you , Nice to meet you too
Oh   there is a supermarket not far from here  But there is also a tea house around the corner   where you can get tea   taste tea and get a tea set as well , Oh yeah   I saw the tea house the other day  I think I might go and have a look sometime  It's a nice neighborhood here
Well   if you want we can go together sometime  Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon   if you like   you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way , That would be wonderful  Thanks !

Yes   her daughter's having a baby   so she's moving in with her to help out  I think if you are interested   you can come over and have a look , Great  It's a lovely neighborhood  And it would be nice to be neighbors again  It would be just like the old days !
I ’ m worrying about the children  After all this is the first time they have been out without us , Don ’ t worry  They are grown-ups
She is going to get married , No wonder ! Who is the bridegroom ?

Love is blind   you know , John's very lateDo you think he's coming ?

There are lots of things   such as postcards   key chains   posters and various arts and crafts , It all sounds great  We can go there after the match  I can't wait to see what they have
Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ? , Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London
And what about the number of people on the streets ? , Oh   I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London
Sitcoms ? , Situation comedies  A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly  Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people  If there is one thing that all the shows have in common   it is teaching wholesome values
Have you been to Shanghai before ? , Yes I have  I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year

I think I'm polite   careful   relaxed and shy , Oh   I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party
So   you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? , Of course !
What are they ? , One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families
That makes sense  Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper , And junk food contains lots of fat and oil  There is one final reason why so many people are fat
Wow ! No wonder people are so fat  Say   Carl   looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising , Yeah   I guess so
So what happened ? , Well   I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds
That sounds good but I don ’ t know what ’ s on , I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant  Let ’ s go and see that
That sounds good  I ’ ll call you once I arrive , So do you think you can get to the office alone ?
If he doesn ’ t understand me   I ’ ll show him the office address on my business card , Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late ?
It's Gone With the Wind , Why do you like it best ?
Is it very interesting ? , Sure  I like the writer's language   too
That's a good idea  Let's go ! , What's that book you have under your arm ?
I checked it out of the rental library  It only costs five cents a day , Is it really worth paying for ?
I am exhausted  I need some sleep , Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ?
MrBen   What do you think of the book ? , It's an excellent one  I like it very much
I agree with you , Where are you going this weekend ?
Yes   actually it ’ s my second visit  I was there last October , I see  What ’ s it like there ?
I like football best of all , Do you ?
I only watch now , My son closed his ear to what I said  I don ’ t know what I should do
Every country should face the history , Yeah   we don ’ t live in the vacuum  We have traditional values and long but different history
I believe such things won ’ t be realized   just daydreaming , I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer
Did you have a good weekend ? , Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much
Ahh  And how about on Sunday ? Did you watch the football ? , No I didn ’ t  I worked in the morning then I played tennis with my husband
Oh really ? What did you do ? , We watched lots of television and films
Well   it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself , What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ?
I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age   because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly , Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday
Oh   he ’ s fine  Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays , He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? , Yes   there is  Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives  They want to go out   have fun   and explore the world  They want to develop their own view of life  Parents usually try to discourage them   but they don ’ t often succeed
How ’ s your father ? , He ’ s fine  He retired last week  It ’ s turning point in his life  Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement
So   he wants to have a more active retirement  Good idea ! , How do you want to spend your old age ?
For almost two years , Almost two years ? Your English is very good
Oh   yes  Beautiful , You are not English   are you ?
No   I don't think we have , My name is Dick Brown
Really ? I am glad to meet you , I'm honored to know you
I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower   the Seine River , And you shouldn't miss the Louvre Museum  You can stay there for at least a whole day
Oh   wonderful ! How is the weather ? , I went there in August   and it was hot  But I was told autumn is the best season
Nothing much  I ’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ’ s all I have planned , So you ’ re free on Saturday night ?
Oh   that would be lovely  Shall we say seven o ’ clock ? , Perfect  I ’ ll pick you up then
Really ? How often do you go there ? , Usually   I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year
What a good day ! , Yes  It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city
Wow   what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery , En   it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it
I think we should go out more frequently  The natural scenery can do us good , That's the point  We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time
I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight  I ’ m having dinner with friends , What a pity  I wanted to go for a drink with you
Shall we go out tomorrow then ? , Why not ? Sounds good to me
Have you travelled to many other countries ? , To be honest   I have never been to an Asian country before but I have visited many countries in Europe
Hi Colin  How are you feeling today ? , Oh   I feel ok but I ’ m still very tired
Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? , Oh yes   I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace
Yes   I'm very pleased  I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony , Wow  You must be very excited
What a good idea  I'm quite hungry , Me too  I feel very thirsty as well
I am on my way out to a New Year ’ s banquet  How do I look ? Is my make-up OK ? , You look great  Your make-up is perfect
Thanks for saying  Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear ? , With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect
Sounds fun  Anyone I know ? , Yeah   most of the people are from our office
Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in , Where else haven't we been to yet ?
Well  there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city  That's half the collections of antique objects in China  There's one exhibition half for multiple collection   and several individual display rooms for private collectors , Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections  I'II go and see each of them  What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on   don't keep me in suspense !
The dinner was really good  It knocked my socks off , That's very kind of you to say so  Let's try some after-dinner wines
Port   please , Excellent choice  I love its smooth flavor
Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine , Oh   what's that ?
OK   here's to your health , Thanks  Cheers
I am happy  I just bought a new car , Wow ! Is it a good car ?
Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap , What colour is it ?
Sure   but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close , That sounds good  You order the beer while I go to the bathroom  Where is the can in this place ?
You're back already  That sure was quick , That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around  That bathroom is too gross for me
Okay   let's go ! , What's Beijing like ?
You can see the Forbidden City , What ’ s it like ?
Yes   I didn ’ t finish work until 9:00 pm , 9:00 !
Because too many people in the office are on holiday , What does your sister look like   Mike ?
I suppose so  We ’ re both friendly and easy-going , Is she as clever as you ?
Jenny   I want to go on a picnic  Could you come too ? , I'd be glad to  I love picnicking
Sure  Bring enough films   please , I sure will
So   you also like Coffee ? , Yes   of course  I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning
But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content   serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system   as well as other organs   and leads to addiction , I don't think so  Coffee helps me wake up   keep alert   and improve my short term memory
You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel , Maybe I could have a try
I bet you had a wonderful time , Yeah   beautiful sunshine   pleasant scenery and many new friends
I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation , Oh   that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ?
To the beach , Have you made your hotel reservation yet ?
Just think   in a few days   I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy , I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain
Your dream will come true  It's really breathtaking , So you're traveling around the world   aren't you
Last night , Did you have a good journey ?
Let me see  Ah   yes   I've been to England   France   Germany   Italy and now I've been in Spain , Really ? How long will your holiday last ?
That's right , We're lucky today

Do you usually have a birthday party ? , Yes   we doMy parents prepare dinner for me
Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ? , Well   I don't know
Yes   actually   the song has been sung since its publication in 1932People all over the world have sung it in many different languages , Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ?
Just buy a cask of wine  Have you bought ice yet ? , No   once I fill the tub with beer   I'll get the ice  The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice  The cooler   the better
Do you want black or white coffee ? , White   please
What kind of music do you like ? , I like classical music  Do you ?
It ’ s true , You are funny !
That ’ s all right  I understand , I ’ m so sorry
It's a man-made wonder  I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it , Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon
Oh   not too bad  I'm just glad the weekend's finally here , I know what you mean  What can I get for you ?
Thanks , Jenny   I want to go on a picnic  Could you come too ?
Can I bring my camera with me ? , Sure  Bring enough films   please
Oh ! Good evening  I'm sorry   but she is not in  She's gone out to the theatre , Oh ! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents
I was preparing my supper but I've finished now , I can leave the parcel with you   can't I ?
Oh   I took up a new hobby , So you don't travel a lot now ?
It certainly is  It's so much fun , I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ?
You're right  And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps , Good
Yes   it's really amazing  I got to go now  I'm meeting with some other collectors , Ok   good luck  See you
What happened ? , She was hit by a car  Luckily   she wasn't seriously hurt
OK  Let's go , What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired
Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced , I can understand  By the way   is there anyway I can help ?
Thank you , How have you been ?
Very well   thank you  I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00   would you care to join us ? , I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t  I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement
Mary said Jack was cheating on her  Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown  One day   May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately , Really ? I ’ m very surprised  He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing   right ?
How so ? , He is an extrovert while she is an introvert  He likes parties while she hates them
Do you think they ’ ll get back together ? , No   I don ’ t think so  I know Mary  Once she makes a decision   she won ’ t change her mind
How's it going ? , I'm in a good mood today   actually  How about you ?
There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around , I see ! Do you want to ask her out ?
But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am , Then you've got a lot of homework to do  You need to get her notice first
But I always get tongue-tied when I see her , That's something you need to overcome  Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased
Have you ever run into a person who tries to bleed you white ? , I am always on the look out for such girls
Hello ? , Hi   Randy  What are you doing right now ?
Sure  What time ? , The film will start at 2

Thank you , My pleasure
Yes   I mean it , But why ? Did I do anything wrong ?
I have thought about it for a while  I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us , But I still love you

I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off , Oh   cheer up  He ’ ll understand you

Hi   Randy  What are you going to do this weekend ? , I ’ Ve no idea  Nothing really
Okay  I ’ ll pick you up around 6 , I ’ ll be ready
Honey   cross my heart   I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me   that's the truth , Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ?
That ’ s why many people look up to him , I cannot ignore her suggestion  In fact I always value her suggestion
And it takes two to make an agreement too  You have no guts   I am afraid , Mary seems depressed  What ’ s the matter ?
Okay   can I ask you something direct ? , Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush
I tell ya   when I got the invite   it really threw me for a loop  You've done a complete 180 , I know  But things have changed  I guess I've settled down

What will you do now ? Propose to her , Of course I won't chill out  Opportunity knocks only once
You know that ? Dan got a divorce , Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much
May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law , Yeah  That's just what is troubling John
When I quarrel with my husband  He didn't even try to cool me out , It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences
Are you sure of that ? , I am not certain about that
Willing to help   maybe   but not as helpful as you think , Really ?
It's inevitable  Their love wasbuilt on the sand   and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks , You said it  Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks
I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her  She's a chatter box , But she means to help you   not to trouble you
That's a relief for me and a misery for the children , Why don't you make up with John
That is a deadly risky business  He should have it coming on him , He must be regretting about having done the business
Don't build a fire under me  I know the importance of time , But you are too slow to follow them

Not really  There are many successful mixed marriage around us , Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
Didn't I ? , You know you didn't
I didn't think you'd be interested , You can't be serious  How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
My old man always harps on me , So does my father  I'm already used to it
Yeah   but he really puts blame on me , Who did the stupid thing ?
Then it must be a naughty boy who did it , I love slim girls   don ’ t you ?
I can ’ t say I do  What I like a girl with good manners , Well   yes  But surely you like a girl with a nice figure
Not particularly  I like a girl to be good , Nice to see you   Patrick
Congratulations ! , Thanks
Oh   you must be very happy  How many people are there in your family ? , My immediate family is very large  It's my mother   my father   my two older brothers   my younger sister and me
Yes   it did  But my parents are ethnic minority people  It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children , Interesting  What do you think about families with only one child ?
Yes   we are very close  He is 12 years old now and very smart  He always makes us laugh a lot , You are very lucky to have such a nice family
Sorry   I can ’ t , Tomorrow night   then ?
That sounds great , Ok  How about give me a ring   then ?
Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it  Thank you for inviting me anyway , Jenny   are you having fun here ?
Thank you for the invitation , It ’ s my pleasure  Would you like another glass of champagne ?
Oh   thank you so much , Really   it was nothing
It was so kind of you , Don ’ t mention it
Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry  I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter , How about Sunday then ?
It suits us fine  We ’ ll see you then , Thanks   goodbye
I ’ ll pick you up at  say   7 30 ? , Yes   that would be perfect
Diana   do you like the perfume I gave you ? , It ’ s good  But to tell you the truth   I don ’ t wear perfume
Excuse me  May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? , What ’ s it for ?
Thank you  I appreciate your help , Are you doing anything tonight ?
Yes   I do   very much , There ’ s a concert tonight  Would you like to go and listen to it ?
Try to keep cool  It's not an easy take , I know  I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst
Everything's great  And you ? , Same hereHave you seen any new films recently ?
Yeah  I found it is so close to our life , It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world
I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married , Oh   that's too short-lived
DefinitelyThey don't take relationships and marriages very seriously , In their mind   love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone
Can't complain  What about you ? , Not bad  Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?
I heard they were just married for 5 months , Yes   she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things
Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married , Yeah  We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners
That's trueJust hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon , I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him
Did you ask his former secretary   Lora ? She knows a lot about him , Thanks for reminding me  She's the right person to help me
Yes   but do you love me ? , Why ? You mean a lot to me
Do you love me ? Come on   I ’ m eager to hear , You know that I care for you  I---I ’ m proud of you
What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? , To be honest   I wouldn't
What's the puzzle ? , My husband and I prefer to have no kids   but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids
Oh   really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren , But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not
Don't worry  I think in most cases   children are the glue that keeps a family together , I guess you're right  But I still prefer to have no child
I'm very sorry I can't , Why not ?
Sally ? She is a bachelor girl  She is an excellent designer  Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains , Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock
Don't be scared  Bite the bullet and everything will be right again , Thanks for encouraging me  There are problems cropping up here and there  But I will overcome them one by one
Yes  I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper , And he ’ s bright and intelligent  I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam
He ’ s a bit tired   you know  It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up , Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays   don ’ t they ?
Yes  After so many years of hard work   I ’ d rather I had an office of my own , If you need help   don ’ t hesitate to ask me
Thank you  I wish I would , Good luck to you
He didn't make any effort  His aunt died and left him a fortune , I didn't expect to see you at this hour  You must have goofed off again
I'm sure of what I'm doing , I didn't expect to see you at this hour  You must have goofed off again
I'm sure of what I'm doing , Why did Tom quit his job ?
What a great weekend that was ! , My feeling's exactly
We should come here more often , You are absolutely right
You are right  We shouldn't do anything under the table , Well   since you agree with me   we should put the issue above board instead of talking about it through other channels
Actually   what bothers me is the violence  There are far too many detective and police shows , I couldn't agree with you more  There aren't enough educational programs   and even the news shows are not well done
Leave him alone   he ’ ll soon stop , How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him  Let ’ s go and see him
Go ahead , I ’ m afraid you ’ ll become angry  But I think I must tell you
I had to announce his innocence in court today   but it left a nasty taste in my mouth , You mean you suspect him
He said I have a big nose  I wonder what that means , You are interested in other people ’ s business   aren ’ t you ?
I ’ m fed up with marriage , Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife
And we have some squabbles on some boring things , This is ordinary marriage life
He would have recovered from the stress and got married again , Once bitten   twice shy  He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust
You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily  I learned English very late   and learned it all by myself  At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment  I have to keep my dictionary on hand , Really ?
I ’ m sure they will , This one looks great ! I love the seashore
Oh   Tom ! They sound fantastic  I really like all those things , Yeah  me   too
You know  I really don't those big hotels , Neither do I  Let's stay in a cabinIt ' ll be much nicer right beside the ocean
I don ’ t understand , He nursed a viper in his bosom  His best friend Tony foamed him in  Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him
I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday  Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? , I'd be delighted to   John  Saturday did you say ?
Oh   good  If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock   that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner , That sounds fine  I'll be there around seven
Tom is making so much noise  I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening , You can talk with him
No   I just started working here at IBM   I am in the sale department , What do you do there ?
Really ? I don't believe I would met him   is he here now ? , Yes   That's him over there - the taller   handsome one  Would you let me introduce you ?
What's that ? , I fell on the way to school   and your bike got scratched  I'm really sorry
That's the most important thing , It's kind of you to say  I feel a little stupid
Maybe   but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well , I appreciate that   thank you
It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area , Really ? In New Berlin ?
Yes  People should look out   because maybe there will be tornadoes comingSo it's called a watch , And the second stage is called a tornado warning
Well  Tornadoes can be dangerous   it's trueIf we hear something like a loud train coming   then we have to go in the basement , What do you mean a loud train ?
Maybe  It depends on the tornadoSome can move across the ground at 200 miles an hourThat is very fast  Others aren't so fast , Have you seen a lot of them ?
No   it didn't  But they are glad I called them , What were they doing when you called ?
Not so many really  But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes , Hello  Is this Ann ?
Do you have a cold ? , No  Worse than that  I have a flu  I'm in bed with a fever
I understand  What should I tell Mr  Morley ? , Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon
Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? , I'm not sure yetMaybe this will all be gone in a daySo it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments  I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think
That bad   huh ? , Yeah   I'm very nauseousIt ' s mostly nausea and a fever
Hope you feel better , Why don't you watch where you're going ?
Hey   listen  I had every right to stay in the lane I was inYou were supposed to wait until I passed to pull outAnd anyhow   you didn't give me any time to change lanesAll of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me , I think my arm is broken
Fine with me  I know the laws of the road  I'm not worried , I have a cell phone in my car  Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger sideWhy don't you get it for me   and then I can call the police ?
Oh   yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first  Then you can go to the hospital , Damn it ! I'm injured here  We could wait all day for the police
Yes   maybe it doesBut if you're going to drive like you did just now   you will have to get used to a little physical pain  You know what I mean ? , To hell with you  The accident was your fault

Mrs  Smith   you are always worried about your children , They are my own flesh and blood  It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering

Oh  that's too bad , Yeah  I really like Lesley
At eight sharpHow about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven ? , That sounds perfectAnd let's go out for coffee after the show
Our son is gone and my heart is gone too  I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years , Oh   darling   we must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music  I know you can pull yourself together
My mother likes to split hairs , What do you mean by that ?
I am tired of everything in my life , What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you
Ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one , The reason is that he once was bitten by a dog
Why ? , We are going to buy our own house
You are pulling my legs ! , I am not blind  Anyone can see that with half an eye
Sure , Thanks
Yesterday  He suffered from a serious disease  When he saw the red light   it was too late , How terrible !
He never see eye to eye with me , That is to say   love is blind
All right  But what was the trouble ? , My car run out of petrol
Please go to see a doctor , Would you like to go with me ? I ’ m afraid of the hospital
Don ’ t make a fuss  Many people divorce after having living together for many years , What a pity
What does the doctor say ? , The disease fails to respond to drugs
So what ? Things have changed , Don ’ t do that again  You are riding the tiger
All is best now   isn ’ t it ? , Jenny is going to marry another man next month
At least I ’ m the one who rates with her  I ’ m glad we can still be friends , Have you met John recently ?
What a pity ! , Mary   I heard you moved again
You know   on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning   our neighbour started to raise Cain , What is up ?
I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more  The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me , Mike promised to help us
He is too unpredictable  He says anything that pops into his head  And then he forgets it all , Mary is such a cautious girl !
Thats a clever way to escape responsibility , He told the police that Ted was the murderer
Because he stayed with me all the time that night , Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ?
We quarreled yesterday   and he picked up and left , Terrible ! Does he want to divorce ?
I have no idea about what to do next , Maybe you can pick Mary ’ s brains now  She knows a lot about stocks
It is very hard   you know , Don ’ t worry  I know there are no pennies from heaven  I will work hard
I calmed up  And finally   I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision  I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal , But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that
Why do you say so ? , The trash of the world he sets high price upon   but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues
That cat , I was not born yesterday  It must be either you or Adam
Don ’ t be too humble  Few young men could be equal to Mark  And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck , I agree  Both Joe and Mark are men of guts
So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg , You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself
It it true of many countries , You know why ?
Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single  Is the man very rich ? , No  That ’ s what is surprising me
I thought she would marry a fortune , In my opinions   someone else has caused the fire of this house
OK   murder will out ! , Yeah
But you look depressed , I have some problem with my work
How about your family ? , Everything is Okay  And as soon as I see my son at home   all my worries vanish into the blue
Then why not keep away from him ? , The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now
Oh   I know  She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing , I hear the school is very modern  It has the best equipments
Oh   I think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father , I always feel I ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on
What do you think of Frank ? , He is all right  But I think he seems to have no back bone
Susan has got married , Really ? How do you know that ?
I have no idea  Maybe she didn ’ t want to let us    so , Have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ?
I absolutely agree with you , Can ’ t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ?
I am just thinking of it  Maybe I ’ ll go , The murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment
No wonder , I don ’ t dare to look after the children now
It is because your children have grown up   and you haven ’ t lived with a child for a long time , I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket
Then he is really lucky , Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ?
Yeah  I think everyone should go easy on driving , What happened to your brother ?
Yes   he ’ s been like this for two weeks  We don ’ t know what to do , Have you talked to him ?

I think it's too short  You'd better say something about your work experience , You're right   I'll change it  How about the last part ?
What would you like to be in the future ? , A teacher
Are you sure about that ? , I'm quite sure  I've always loved working with children
How come ? , I'm not practicing enough
You should always keep in mind   the more you practice   the better English you can speak , You're going to Shanghai tomorrow   are you ?
Do you think I'll need a cotton coat ? , Not for now   I think   But I believe there'll be rain   so take your raincoat with you
You don't mind if I have one , Well   all tight  But you know   smoking does do harm to your health
I've tried to give up smoking several times   but it's no use , Betty   would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion
If I were you   I would change the beginning  You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities , Good idea   Betty  What would you think about the second part ?
Very good  But you should talk about your family   too , I agree  I appreciate your helping me
No   I'm still single , Then   you put S in this blank
Are you married ? , YesIs that so important ?
Which season do you like best ? , I like spring
I like spring   tooWe can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air , It's nice and bright today   isn't it ?
That's a hard timeThe air is cold and damp   and the road is often icy , It's boring   right ?
PlentyWe never worry about lack of rainwater in our area , So you should bring an umbrella often
I'm glad I was able to help , It's most kind of you
Thank you , I'm most grateful
I don't mind at all , All rightAre you married ?
I don't knowIt ' s still up in tha air , Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ?
Yes   my first marriage was a failure , It's too hot to read
Spring , How about summer ?
Because the hottest season is summer in a year , But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons
What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? , Stop producing cigarettes
How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? , Maybe it can take effect
How about going to English corner with me ? , Oh   I'd rather not
That's why you should go there   If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes   you simply will never learn English , Are you a smoker ?
No  But my husband smokes 20 or more a day , When did you begin to smoke ?
Yes  Twice , Can I see your parents some time tomorrow ?
Yes   I think so , I'd like to say good-bye to everyone
Well   good-bye and have a good trip ! , Good-bye  Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington
No   I just want to meet you , How about tomorrow instead
I've come to say good-bye , When are you off ?
Please don't forget to say good-bye to the rest of the family for me , I just dropped in to say good-bye
Take care and give my best to your parents , Good-bye  Hope to see you soon again next year
That's a good ideaWhat time is good for you ? , How about Saturday morning ?
When do you leave ? , I'm catching the eleven o'clock train
What's the bonus like at your company ? , Well   it's OK   I suppose  We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary
Hey   I know what that's like  I bought a BMW on my Visa card  Now the payments really hurt , Well   you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments  I missed a credit payment last month  Now my bank account's overdrawn   and the company is threatening to take back my purchases
Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racketThey ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen   if I were you   I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical , You're kidding !
How do you do   MrSmith ? This is Lili  I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday  I enjoyed it very much , You're welcome  I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime
Yes  I appreciate all help and in particular   all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here , Don't mention it  I am pleased to help you
Hello   Jill , Tom   You're back   come in pleaseHow are you ?
Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence , That's all rightWould you have a cup of coffee ?
The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very wellYou are very helpful  I want to thank you for everything you've done for me , It's my pleasure
Not at all , Have you received your TOWEL test results yet ?
Well   I certainly couldn't have done it without your help  You are the best tutor I've ever had , Thank you   but it was your hard work that did it
That's all tight   MrSmithThat ' s my job  I'm very glad he recovered so soon , I know he has brought great trouble to you  A million thanks
I think your speech was excellent , Was it ?
But you did it and did it well ! , Hello   Bobby   It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock
I see  Where are you now   Li ? , Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge
That's too bad   But don't worryWe ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock , I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting
Why   Tom ? It's five to six already and you are still writing here , So what ? Are we going anywhere ?
What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there , I'm terribly sorry   RoseBut I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me
And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long , Not at all
Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ? , No problem
You are always like this  I've told you many times not to tell her , Sorry   I had no intention
We can't wait any longer , I'm terribly sorry to be so late  I had an article
All rightNow that everybody's here  Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin   are you ready ? , Yes   thanksBefore I start   I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials
What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable , It's us
That's right , And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself
You mean I am groaned a few words ? , Totally not  Perhaps it's about our marriage
I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it , Thank you for the invitation
Many happy returns of the day   darling ? , Thank you very much
Do you like it ? , I love it ! Darling   you ’ re kind
Really   it was nothing , I really appreciated it
Don ’ t mention it , You ’ re a real friend in need
It ’ s for a book , Oh   that ’ s a nice idea  Well   it ’ s fine if you take our picture
It ’ s good  But to tell you the truth   I don ’ t wear perfume , I ’ m sorry  I didn ’ t know that
I don ’ t really mind , We can go to that new Chinese restaurant
All right  If you really want to , How about a movie tonight ?
Either way  I don ’ t care , How about a snack after work ?
Whatever you say , Are you really interested in doing something ?
So what ? , You want to watch   don ’ t you ?
You look so happy   Anna  Any good news ? , Yes  I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest
By the way   would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday , Good   happy birthday to you !
My pleasure , I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening
Oh  That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film , It sure is
But I don't even know what to study , If I had chance again   I'd major in English  You're good at language
But if you go to university   you'll still have time for fun , Hm   what you say makes sense  But you know   I still have to ask my parents for pocket money   and I hate to do so at this age
Where were you last night   at exactly nine twenty PM ? , nine twenty pm   I couldn't say  I cann't remember
Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? , I'm not quite positive  I think I went out at about half pass nine
Sure ? , Quite sure
Hmm  I have the same problem  When I leave work   it ’ s always rush hour  So the buses are always crowded , Oh   yeah   it ’ s terrible  I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China  It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus   and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt
You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full   so I waited for the second   and it was still very crowded  Then I decided not to wait for the next one   and got on the second bus  It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! , Hmm  Good exercise   uh ?
You were so happy   weren ’ t you ? , What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy
That sounds like my Grandmother  She was always stubbornly independent , It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own
Susan   I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend , A house warming party ?
Well   we have always dreamed of owning our own home   but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive , I understand  That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town   far from the city
Mom   you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you , Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine
Do you ever get lonely living alone ? , Not at all  I see you and your family twice a week   and I enjoy seeing my own friends  I ’ m too busy to feel lonely !
I ’ m happy to meet you  It seems everyone in town is so friendly , This is a small town   and we like to be neighborly  We know everyone who lives around here
We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space  Another reason is   we can afford to buy a home here   but we can ’ t in Chicago ! , I saw an interesting program on TV last night  It was about elderly people
I think that many physicians now agree with that idea , And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress
Umm  I think so  What's up ? , I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies  but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim
If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered , Hummum  I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about thatAnyway  now that I'm going to have to make some claims   I think I'd better try and understand how the system works  Would you mind breaking it down for me ?
Yep  Every country in the world has a different system   but here we buy insurance from a private provider , So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job   right ?
Well   I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown , That's cool  Have you already found an apartment to live in ?
You mean they're kicking you out ? , Not really   they just don't want me living at home  My older sister did that   and she lived at home for seven years  Once she started living at home   it got harder and harder for her to move out
I know I need to learn that myself   but I just don't have the money for it at the moment  Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place , So Chris   I've heard that you're from a big family  How many people ?
Well   my mother came from a big family   and wanted to have one of her own  My father was an only child   and didn't really care about having a large family   but my mother talked him into it , Jeez   seven children  That must have a lot of problems  We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right
That's one  Another is the lack of personal property  Everything you have   from toys to clothes   is used by your brothers and sisters  Especially clothes  Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs , And the age gap is also annoying  There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me  We have nothing in common
They do   but it doesn't help too much  Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight , Darling   I have news for you  Bobby and his wife   Evelyn   are going to have a baby soon
Oh   what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it  He likes children and always wants a child of his own , In fact   they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby  Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like   since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese
Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact   isn ’ t it ? , Do you have much experience with kids ?
I understand  I was in your position before  At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me  My husband seldom stayed at home , What about your mother ? Did she help you ?
Don ’ t worry  You can take night classes  I did that when I had kids  And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten  Then you could find a job and work , Sounds not so easy to me  When that happens   I will be too old to learn
I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime , No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently  Where did you spend your holidays ?
Yes  We enjoyed ourselves very much  Have you traveled much   Luke ? , No   my wife doesn ’ t like traveling  We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years  The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married  We spent our honeymoon in the Alps
Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports  I go to football or baseball games a lot  And I read sports magazines every week , Wow !
Oh   I see  You know   we spend time doing different sports  How much time do you spend exercising ? , Well   I guess I exercise about two hours a day  I do aerobics three times a week   and the other days I play badminton with my husband  I always feel good afterward
Oh   I ’ m too lazy to play sports   and I ’ m not good at anything either  It hardly excites me , I can ’ t wait to retire
That sounds boring to me , What do you plan on doing after you retire ?
Hey   Ben  did you catch the game last night ? , Uh  what game ?
Football of course ! , Oh  football  Football is cool  I usually try to catch the World Cup finals
So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? , Yes   I think so  But to be perfectly honest   I'm not really a sports nutWhen I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team  Are you a diehard football fan ?
Oh   yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young  Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together , I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy   so energetic  It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday
Oh   do you know why ? Actually   it ’ s easy  Because I always exercise  My exercise   I think   is very hard  I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties  I feel alive ! , Oh   I know  I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you
But I think Chinese students need to exercise more  Besides exercise will help them learn new things better  Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? , Of course  I didn ’ t know that  I only know exercise makes bodies stronger  I should take some exercise then  Do you have any suggestions ?
Hi   Mr  Zhang  What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy  How was your date ? , I was turned down again  It ’ s frustrating  I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills
Believe it or not   I guess American women like a man in good shape   which Chinese women may not care about so much  That ’ s my honest opinion  I know you have been trying very hard , American men are naturally taller than Chinese men  So even if I exercise   there aren ’ t many chances
Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl   you could still have a stronger and healthier body  You won ’ t lose anything by doing that , Hi   Kate
Have you noticed what has changed ? , Oh   you look quite slender and more vivacious  What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ?
What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work  I ’ m taking an amateur dance class  I dance two hours everyday , Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard  I can do that
Wow ! Sure ! , I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch
I'd love to help if I can , Well   as you know   I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far   but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work  maybe even get a Doctorate !
Yeah   I'd have to say it has  But I'm still paying for it   you know , I know education is expensive   but it's been my lifelong dream  Call me crazy   but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name
I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling  It's not as romantic as you might think , Yeah  I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate  I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare
I've been really stressed  It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work , Well   stress is a real thing  It's not an imaginary condition
Yeah   but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office  My stress is just about silly paperwork ! , But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response  Each time you feel like something's threatening you   your body decides whether to run away or fight  it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body
So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? , Hey Susan   what are you coming as this year ?
Um  I have to confess   I haven't given it much thought  I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there , Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ?
Well   people sometimes set off firecrackers   some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incenseMainly though   you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry , Feed them ?
Yes ! How did you guess that ? , It makes sense   right ? Who else is going to eat it ?
No ! So  is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? , I heard you are going to move
I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff  You know   I have a lot of stuff , You can call a mover
I think it ’ s a little expensive , But think about it   you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers   how much trouble you will save
Wonderful , It ’ s 8357688 8
Hey   look at the offer I got in my e-mail  It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! , Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ?
But it seems like a good idea  All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter  After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money , Sounds like a pyramid scheme  Have you heard of those before ?
Sounds good to me  The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him , Not exactly  The scam keeps on going   with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom
I see  I guess I should be more careful about what I read   especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is , Hi Amanda   how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week
What happened ? , Well   three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person
Well   every department is different  You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch   right ? , What is that ?
Who ’ s that ? , It ’ me  Susan Taylor
Yeah   I ’ m trying to decorate my house , Really   that ’ s cool  Let me see what you ’ Ve done
It ’ s just a simple decorating  I just want to add my personality to my living space , I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs
It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style , Oh   I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses
No   it has three bedrooms and three beds   and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling  There ’ s a two-car garage , That ’ s a nice area too  It ’ ll be a good investment for you
Right   congratulations , Thank you
Don ’ t worry  It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized , Don ’ t say that  It looks like a dump now  I can ’ t stand it
What do you mean by that ? , I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station  It took me 20 minutes
Is there a supermarket nearby ? , Yes   if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket
Can you believe the headlines ? , What are you reading ?
He got arrested all right , If I remember   he got off with a light sentence  Something like three years in a minimum-security prison
That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad  Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail , I know  And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years
He's giving lectures on business at colleges , So   Jack   do you believe in ghosts ?
You saw a ghost ? When ? , It was many years ago   when I was a little child  It was the middle of the night   and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen  I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs   when
So what did you do ? , I hid so that it couldn't see me  Slowly it got closer and closer   until
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? , Yeah   about
Oh   yeah  Many Chinese like to bargain  It happens almost everywhere , I mean   I understand that  But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster   until it seemed to me that they would fight  My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match  The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation
Yes   perhaps  Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing  Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us , Yes   absolutely true
It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future , Oh   you mean palm reading  I've seen that before   but I don't believe in it
Ok   let's see   well   you've got a long life line   which is good   and the love line is strong , What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ?
You seem to have a large gullibility line  You believe everything that you're told , Ok   so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?
But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! , Why can't we ?
But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! , I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill  It's only a superstition  It really doesn't mean anything
That's better , Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding  I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony  Is that common ?
It wasn't  It was birdseed  We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it , Oh   I didn't think of that  Well   this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China  Plenty of food and drink   music and dancing   and interesting traditions
She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece  I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time , What a great weekend that was !
I couldn't agree with you more , We should come here more often
That's exactly the way I feel , Have you heard about Anlesen David ?
You must be jokingThose two , Well   my dear  I didn't believe eitherBut got it straight form the horse's mouthDavi called me this morning
Well   I believe it now   and when are they are getting marry ? , Next june
John   they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside  That ’ s their custom , I know   but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us   and without warning
I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families , I think you ’ re right !
You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy , That's what I thought  It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months
So you asked him about the girl who called ? , Yeah   he first said it was someone from work  He gave me a lame excuse   and so I pressed him on it
Dalian is a beautiful city  Do you agree ? , I suppose I do
This city is really comfortable to living , It sure is
Maybe , I'm sorry   but I can't go
When poyou have to see her ? , I have an appointment at one fifteen
Yeah   I know what you mean  The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples   not to mention two people from different cultures , And now we have a two-year-old boy  We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart
What does he look like ? Can people tell ? , Yes   people surely can  He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids   and his hair is a little blonde  My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though
Then why are so many crazy about it , I don't knowMaybe they are really crazy
No   what ? , He's got a promotion
I don't believe itHe is only being with the company for two years , Well   it's trueThe board man last thirdly and they choice Paul
I don't believe it , And I score three of them
I can believe that , What do you think of doctor Thomson ?
I can tell form the way he spoke to us , Never believe his words
She got a master degree   and now she is going for her doctor , Really ? I can't believe it
Do you think they two will get married ? , You can count on it
You're right  He sure is , I'm exhausted  My new exercise is so hard
Oh   without doubtWhen is the next class ? , Tomorrow morningTry it
Of course   easyNo sweat , You're no able to move after this class
Yeah   what't the bet ? , I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing
I think it ’ s important to do now  We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital , But it won ’ t be on my birthday
Well   thanks all the same   Denise  But no I don't thinkSorry   I'm sure you would enjoy it  I'd like to Denise   but I'm busy on friday this week and next week too , But I said thursdayThe tickets are for thursday evening
Yes  some other time perhapsThanks again , I want to change my job
I see , Not only that  The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine
And my first nephew  He looks a lot like you   mum  He does , Do you think so ? Well   I guess  He does look a lot like me  Oh   he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though
It ’ s true  Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways  And she is shy with new people just like he is , You often like comparing children with their parents
Pretty good  I ’ Ve just had my new poems published , Congratulations on your success
He is fine , He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study   really ?
Thank you  He ’ s very lucky indeed , Morning   Tom
Yes  I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute , Okay  I won ’ t hold you up then
David   I ’ m going to China , Really ? How do you get the chance ?
Thank you  I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning , I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip  China is such a beautiful country
Thank you   David , Nice to see you   Patrick
Congratulations ! , Are you all right ?
I see , Hi   Mary   it ’ s been a long time
Not so well  To be honest with you   I broke up with Tom , Oh  I ’ m sorry to hear that  What happened ?
How are you these days ? , Fine   thank you  And you ?
Morning   Mike , I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday
Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? , I ’ Ve already got it  Thanks
Hi   Lilly   it ’ s so nice to see you again , Hum   me too  This winter holiday was especially long  What have you done ?
Excuse me   are you Miss Green ? , Yes  May I help you ?
I ’ m a new student in the school  My name ’ s John , Nice to meet you   John
Pretty bad  I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it , I ’ m sorry to hear that  Is there anything else I can do ?
Thank you for your concern , Dick   I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house
Why is that ? , Well   I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work
Sorry   I really can't do that  There's little time left for us , I can't accept your excuse  It's five o'clock
I can ’ t decide what to do today , Well  Let ’ s go swimming
Who ’ s this ? your girl-friend ? , No   it ’ s my sister
She is tall ? , Yes   she is
I ’ Ve got a new boss , Oh   what ’ s he like ?
And a white sports car , Um   that ’ s good
Yes   certainly  How can I recognize him ? , He is short   well-built   and he ’ s got light blond hair
How old is he ? , He is in his late thirties
Is this your new teacher ? , Yes   it is
What color are her eyes ? , They ’ re dark gray
And how old is she ? , I don ’ t know
Oh   what about Saturday ? Are you free then ? , Saturday my parents are coming to town  What ’ s up ?
Yes   yes   I want to take you to dinner , Oh   that sounds great  How about 6 o ’ clock ?
Do you like this campus ? , Well  I ’ m rather disappointed with it
OhIt ’ s awful   but it can ’ t be helped , I ’ ll just have to put up with it
I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 , That ’ s in one month   and besides   this is a group date with all of our friends
What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish , These girls are different   they are not wimpy
I talked to them probably about two weeks ago  Yeah   everything is going well , Are you going to see them soon ?
I think I have traits of both   actually  I look more like my mother , Did you like the party ?
I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting , I want take shell on a date   but I don ’ t have much money
Sounds like she has pretty pricy tastes , Well   I really like being with her
Not where   what  Dutch means you both pay your own way , Oh   I wonder if she ’ ll go for that
And how well can you speak them ? , Well   French was my best subject at school  I can read and write it pretty well
I see  Well   we have a lot of Spanish customers   but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here , In that case   I'm fit for the position I think
How well can you speak them ? , I can speak German quite well   but I can't speak French very well
Can you speak English ? , Yes I can  I speak it very well
What else can you speak ? , Well   I know a little Italian
I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem  In these kind of things   the trouble doesn't always appear at first , But everything has been so easy
Okay  Have it your way   but don't say I didn't warn you , I don't know how to adjust my life  Would you give me a piece of advice ?
You should get plenty of sleep , I drink a lot of wine
You better do some exercise every morning , I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me
Which ? Zina ? What time is it ? , It's seven-thirty  I want to know who left this note on my desk
And ? What does it say ? Isn't there a name ? , It says   Zina   I like how you rhumba  An admirer
You'd better give up smoking  It's bad for your health , You're right   but you know   it's hard to give up an old habit
Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work , Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it
Again ? , At his last start-up   Bob worked for stock and no salary  They folded and he made zip
Vince   I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker , Pardon ?
It isn't Elvin , Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious
Not cash  But if our launch goes well   my stock options will pay off   big time , And in the meantime   how do you pay the rent ?
Right here  Me and my PC  Home sweet home , Whoa  Now I'm awake ! Zina has a secret admirer
Sorry   Dave   I didn't mean you  I am just not in the mood for this  I have work to do , Who do you think it is ?
I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast  I appreciate it , Save it   Vince  After I put my first million in the bank   I'll say you're welcome
Ha   she is unstoppable  I'm learning so much from her , What's it like to work with her ?
You guys are working around the clock   I know  That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves , Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month
What if I said no ? , Ever hear of WebTracker ?
OK  If you sign the Starscom account before WebTracker does   we'll talk next week , I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action
We'd better get back to work , Yeah   I'm not too worried about Vince   but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver
It would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters , Vince says he can't afford anybody else  We're got to come through
Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? , No way  I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself  Plus   what if it's Vince ?
A little distraction might do you some good   Zina , Zina   can I talk to you about something personal ?
Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? , He said not to bother coming back  And I said   fine   I won't
And it's all coming down to the next three weeks , The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina
OK   Ann   you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? , I really liked living in Australia  I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney  And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney  There are lots of great clubs  And people were very   very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney
Oh   OK , And I travelled a little bit in Australia  I went up the east coast  Up to Frasier Island  Which is a world heritage site  And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water  We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the    which is a but north  And the further north you go in Australia   the hotter it gets  So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license   so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly
Almost  Ah   you're lucky  Um   it's funny   you go in the water and you worry about sharks   but not clams , Exactly
Hello Michael , Hello Todd
OK  What are the biggest cities ? , The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney   then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth  But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia  And Perth is on the west coast   but sort of of out there by itself
Oh   nice  Actually   what is the capital city of Australia ? , Ah   Canberra is the capital city  But is not the biggest city  Sydney is the biggest city  Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded  It's a separate territory
Japanese art ? Mm   Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! , Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony
Yes   with one piece of cloth   and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl , How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ?
Well   thank you , What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ?
Do ya ? , Yeah   so maybe it's my diet
Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! , Hello sir  Good to meet you   too
Pretty good  There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad  The worst thing was the guy behind me  He snored all through the night ! , Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ?
Not much  but that's ok  I'm a night owl anyway , So   aside from visiting our factory and offices   are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ?
So will you come to work with us ? , Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ?
Don't push your luck   Dave , OK   I'm in  When do I start ?
and what if it doesn't work out   right ? , Exactly
Because I won't let it fail , But what about tomorrow ? What if Starscom decides to go with WebTracker   and not us ?
Great ! So   are you ready for a full day of shopping ? , Yep  Let's do it  I'm pretty excited !
Well  I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person  You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that  But  if you're smart   you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price , Cool ! Teach me !
That could be helpful  But when you go into a shopping center  prices become very flexible  You have to be able to read the market , OK  Steven   you're looking at a picture  Please describe what you see !
Yeah   yeah   yeah  many times  Many times  When I was younger   you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities , Oh   really  Mm ! How much is the fare ?
Hmm   yeah   well this girl here at the back   that's leaning on the door   um   she looks really bored   actually  Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! , Is that how you feel on the bus ?
Um   yes   sometimes  Sometimes , This place is so quiet and peaceful  It ’ s really different from my pad at city
That ’ s what I was thinking  I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels , I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that
Maybe  But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds , Morning   Zina  Just wanted to say thanks again !
Can't Elvin handle it ? , I think he's got too much on his plate
Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? , That's right  Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her
That's right  And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing , Way to go   Mary  A lot has happened during the last few months   hasn't it ?
They work for Zina now , And they're happy with that ?
You do ? , Look   maybe I shouldn't tell you this   but I'v going over to WebTracker   too
No kidding ! I can't believe this  You devil ! , It's kind of cool   isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent
I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? , Yeah   I guess I did  They're going to buy invoking ?
Hi   dear   do you know what the important day is today ? , I don ’ t know
Come on   dear  I know you mustn ’ t forget it , It ’ s Saturday   a great weekend
No   you haven ’ t  You just don ’ t care about me  You ’ re an indifferent husband , What day is it on earth ?
He has no sense , If I were him   I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money
I'm looking for it   but you see   the market shard for jobs   too , You liar   I saw you again in the inn  I bet you don't want to work at all
He might be driven up a wall  You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves , But when I noticed that he was left in the cold   I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation
Yeah  We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home , Susan is going to get a divorce
Oh   I see  But I think you are making a fuss  They will make it up  Bet it , Hey   Gucci  I didn't know it would be a charity show  You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance
Good idea , Who will sing in the show ?
Me too  She is so young and talented  She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself , Yeah  Though she was so popular   I heard she managed to maintain a low profile
Well   I suppose people have different tastes on music  Moreover   here stuff is really strong and creative  It takes time for people to accept new things , You are right  Anyway   things will be different as the days go on  She can get it  I have faith in her
OK , Every year   the South has the floods  It is an act of God
Think   in some way it is an act of God   but in another way   it just is caused by us , For example ?
John dates her seven times a week , Really ? That's a straws in the wind
How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? , At least   it is better than my boxed lunch at work  I'm so fed up with the bland food  Thank you for having lunch with me !
Hey   it's not that bad  The food is nutritious and it's really convenient  I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff , Eating is important  You are what you eat  It's not only a daily routine
But you didn't eat anything today , Well   the bill is paid by month  That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant
No   I never did  It's for my son  He loves it   and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week , That's really smart  My son Daniel is the same with your son  I just don't get it   why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food
Sandra is actually blue chipper  I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women , That's fate

Since everyone is different   your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal , Sounds pretty good  What about the charge ?

Look   is that Tom ? , It's a lovely day   isn't it ?

Well   it ’ s hard to say  I coughed a lot in the evening , You ’ d better give up smoking  It ’ s bad for your health
You know I often have to work far into the night  I need smoking to keep me awake , Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work

Oh   really ? , Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ?
Many customers didn't want them , How about giving them to that old man ?

Anyway   let's just finish out job and get back home , Okay  How tiring the job is !

Honey   just do it next time  Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ? , No   but tell me some  I am interested
I am sure you will  There are some works   and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors  And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train , But I still prefer the pop music in the subway

I agree  I heard in the western countries   almost everyone likes coffee  Is that true ? , Yes  No doubt about that  For us   coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink  I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee
Hey   what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? , Gatorade  It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality

Honey   listen to me  First   you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out , Mom   it's so terrible  Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned

I can't consider you as a little kid any more  I know he is very tall , Oh   you know something  He is 226 meters tall  But he is also nimble and skillful
That's really terrible  Oh   God   we forgot to cheer for Daddy , Never mind  After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming   right ?
Hey   Daddy   today I had really a fantastic history class , Wow   it's so strange for you to say things like that  What had happened ?

Of course   all the workers here are able to swim   and they will come to your aid quickly , Hey   Shirley  The party has been wonderful  My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much   and me too

I will  Actually   I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before , Oh   don't worry about that here  There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood  You know   they are all very strong
That's terrific ! , By the way   a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow  I hope I can see you there

Oh   that's new to me  So what's on everyday ? , News about current affairs   documentaries   music   movies   noncommercial ads and so on

I picked up guitar at an early age   maybe around 8 years old  Afterward   I taught myself by listening to some records of top players , Wow   that's unbelievable ! You play so well   but you've never been to a real teacher  You will definitely be famous in the near future
Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam  So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in , Studying in the university is not easy   but it's not as arduous as you think
Oh   really ? Were you not caught ? , Of course not  You are allowed to attend any lecture   only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class  In universities   you study in a free and creative environment

Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ? , It tells a romantic and humorous love story
And ? , And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy
Of course   they are out there , But I never saw them
That's right  I can see them in my dreams , They come to the earth ?
OK   OK   one by one   please ! They look like robots   but they can speak  Their mission is to make friends with human beings , That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?

Yeah   some places are very short of water , Because of pollution and other things   our environment has become worse and worse
I heard that Ann had divorced , I suspect it's unavoidable
What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? , He's a sad dog  He came to the wedding in jeans !
It's inevitable  Their love wasbuilt on the sand   and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks , You said it  Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks
That's a relief for me and a misery for the children , Why don't you make up with John
Are you sure of that ? , I am not certain about that
Willing to help   maybe   but not as helpful as you think , Really ?
I can't deny that  She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight  I wish I knew more about her , But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl
Yeah  That's just what is troubling John , Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread
Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? , What ? Beg your pardon
You know that ? Dan got a divorce , Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much
What will you do now ? Propose to her , Of course I won't chill out  Opportunity knocks only once
Does Tom drink a lot ? , Yes   he does  He of ten has had one to many  But I advised him not to drink too much   he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table
He asked me to beef up in the work , Yeah  You look so unhappy recently  What ’ s the matter
Yeah  I have got much pressure in the company  I have to be wrapped up in my work , Take good care of yourself
Yeah , Are you sure ?
Partly   and he's also a hard working man , You seem to very busy these days  What are you doing ?

No   this is my first  Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home  I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late  But I was the first one there , I'll bet you were a little embarrassed
Thanks for telling me this , I was late getting back from the mall   but I'm hurrying
Merry Christmas ! , Huh ?
Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? , Actually   I'd forgotten about it
Oh   I'm sorry  I didn't know , It's all right  There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian
Well   would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? , Not at all  A party is a party  I'll be happy to come
Well   everything seems to be just about ready  Now all we need is snowDo you exchange the presents in the morning ? , Oh   yes  The kids are too excited to wait  After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast  Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys
Why do you say that ? , The city is beautiful   the off    the offices are modern and comfortable   and the work is so interesting
Well   many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries , I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy
I'm a GS - 15  That's high on the scale of workers   but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage , Which church do you attend ?
Mormons believe that   after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10   their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men  In 1830   a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church , Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ?
Yes , Why do you really go to church ?
Yeah  But he soon feel regretted for it , But he seems to be very happy with Rose
Ask me a question ? What do you want to know ? , Well  er  it is just  just that I
Lend you a few bucks ? No way ! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time ? , Yeah  But I

Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? , I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother  But he likes Jenny  She is a big apple in his eye
Why are you cut up recently   Nancy ? , I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend
Where is Tom ? , He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep
Oh   I see , What did he say ?
Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question   you know , It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas
Easier said than done , You married Joe   didn't you ?
Oh   I took a shine to him when we met for the first time  But it comes and goes , It's Greek to me
Really ? Does Mary know that ? , Of course not
I think it is easy  I could work in your class with no problem , You thing so ?
No problem , Are you going to this class this morning ?
Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake , You want to bet ?
Linda   would you care for some candies or cookies ? , No   don't try to tend me  I'm becoming chubby   and I have to slender down
So you are watching your weight   aren't you ? , Yes   to tell you the truth  I am on the diet
How do you find the prices there ? , I think they are quite reasonable   and the vegetables are very fresh

No   I don't like museums  They're boring , Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?
Yes   very  I thought the last speaker was especially good , Let me introduce myself   by the way  My name's Thomas Bradley
It's Nugent   N-U-G-E-N-T   but just call me Ted , Ok   I'm Tom
Me ? I'm in the car business , Salesman ?
Oh   really ? What do you do there exactly ? , I'm in the Personnel Department
With the job ? , With everything   with everybody   with all this !
What do you mean ? , Well   I mean  We always do the same thing  There's no variety in our lives
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? , Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry  I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter
Does 6 thirty suit you ? , It suits us fine  We ’ ll see you then
I don ’ t know , Please think it over
It ’ s Saturday   a great weekend , Ur   you really let me down
What day is it on earth ? , It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding
25th Sep ? Oh   I have an appointment tonight , What time is your appointment ?
I don't know what time it is , It must be about 6 o'clock
Do I need a visa ? , No   I shouldn ’ t think so  But you must take your passport of course
Really ? That ’ s very good of you   Helen  But I must get a new suitcase   my old one needs repairing , You needn ’ t buy one  You can have mine
That was a great party  Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up , It certainly was a great party  It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here
I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag , Afterwards   we can do the washing up together  Everything will be finished within an hour  Your friend Keith is really funny  I liked his magic tricks
I think that she had a litter too much of the punch , What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great   but was quite strong
That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes   so I think everyone liked it a lot  How ’ s that stain ? , All cleaned up  Are you ready to start on the washing up ?
Yes  I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper , And he ’ s bright and intelligent  I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam
He ’ s a bit tired   you know  It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up , Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays   don ’ t they ?
I like it  It makes the city feel alive  I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans , I think that there are too many of them  I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising  They should have lower prices instead  Then they would see more
Yes   that annoys me too  With billboards   you can look away   but with broadcasts   you can ’ t avoid them  I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign , I like that too  I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product   you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something
I have a typical 9 to 5 job  Actually   I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days , Do you get paid onetime ?
We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1  we can take coffee breaks during the day  My boss doesn ’ t mind   as long as we get out work done on time , My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks  I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork   doesn ’ t it ?
I work in a cubicle too   but I I don ’ t mind it , I ’ d love to have my own farm
Running a farm would be totally different to you current job , That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it  I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office
Well   I ‘ d certainly come and visit you  It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm  I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while , What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ?
I agree  People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence , Yeah  And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
That ’ s great idea  But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? , No  they don ’ t  they simply charge higher prices at peak times  Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ?
Well   there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes  Shall we ? , What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ?
No  if you do that   the workers won ’ t like their jobs  They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover  Those things will increase you costs , How can a business maximise revenues ?
Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services  Price yourself near the low end  Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else   because many customers distrust very cheap things  They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap , What ’ s your city like ?
Not really  Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre   especially in the main shopping areas  The public transport system is pretty good , What about restaurants and entertainment ?
There are several good clubs near the city centre  Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ”   so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas , It sounds like a really exciting city to live in
I just don ’ t find it very interesting , I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event
I ’ m not sure about that  We still have many wars in the world  I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one   but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete  There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other , You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed   skill   agility and strength  Most people hope to see someone from their country win   but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete
When I was at school   I was quite good at track and field events  I was on the school team for the long jump   100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin , Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus
No   I was good at the long jump  I liked the sprints best , Did you ever win any competitions ?
Yes   I did   but I didn ’ t do very well  I made the final in both events   but came last  At least I made the final  I was very pleased with that , Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship
We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters , That ’ s great  Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition  They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win
A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters  Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump   but it only got him third place , Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting  One competitor made two false starts
I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose  It was very interesting , I love dogs  They have been used as guards for centuries  Nowadays   they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers
Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts , Can you ride a horse ?
What a good idea ! , What are you doing ?
No   there aren ’ t  this map just show the geographical features  Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world , The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water  Compared to the oceans   most countries are tiny
The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate , It ’ s all so interesting  I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet  Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class
Is it really completely flat ? , Pretty much  The land rises and falls only a few meters  The southeast   the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters  There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country
That doesn ’ t sound too bad  Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers  There are cliffs   then sandy beaches  Then rocks  There are lots of caves in the cliffs  There are also many small islands off the coast   but few people lives on them , There are many lakes and rivers in your country too  We also have many rivers   but only a few lakes
I think most people treat animals well   but we are often cruel to animals  When we raise animals for food   the conditions they live in are often poor , Perhaps people should stop eating animals  We could grow more crops
That ’ s true  I think zoo are a good idea   because they allow people to get close to animals  I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals , I agree  I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo  I don ’ t like animals experiments though  I believe that we can do tests in other ways
Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals   but those stories are rare , Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals
Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed , Well  There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them
So would I  what other unusual plants did they show ? , They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee  The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar  Other insects cannot get it  Of course   when the insect collects the nectar   it also takes some pollen from one flower to another
I see  The plants that fascinate me most are cacti  I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions , According to the documentary   they have an incredible ability to find water supplies   however small   and then store them without losing much through evaporation
Thank you  I have roses   tulips   and daffodils  Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? , Yes   I do  Those are violets   aren ’ t they ?
Thank you ! That would be very kind of you  I have a saw in the garden shed , When the lower branches are removed   you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree
Good morning  I ’ m from the New York book review  Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ? , Sure  Take a seat  what would you like to know ?
How do you research your books ? , I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories  Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met  Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people
Oh ! Thank you very much  I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories  What are the stories about ? , There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book  I haven ’ t finished all of them yet   though  Many of them are short detective stories   but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones  If you give me your business card   I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review
I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe   several countries in asia   china   Japan   korea   and Thailand   and to the united states and Canada , I thought you had been to Australia too
isn ’ t it really cold there ? , well   the north of Norway is almost always cold   but further south it can be fairly warm in summer  It ’ s a wet country   so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter
We need to talk about the size of the country and its population , Ok  China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 13 billion   making it the latest country in the world by population
We could divide into five parts  There ’ s the northeast   which is mild in summer and very cold in winter  Then there is the northwest   which is largely desert  Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate  The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts  One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer  Then   in the south it is hot most of the year , That sounds very general
Yes  The other large cities are Chengdu   Dalian   Wuhan   tianjin   shenyang   Chongqing  Hongkong and Guangzhou , We should take a large map and highlight those cities  What is each of them famous for ?
Where have you been ? , I just got back from London
That ’ s too bad  How long was the flight ? , It was 10 hours
Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? , Yes  I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you !
What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? , Those tow games are quite different  First   there ’ s the size of the teams  In football   a team has 11 players  In rugby there are 15 players on each team  The biggest difference is that in football   only the goalkeeper can use his hands  In rugby   the ball is usually carried forward by players   though kicking is permitted
I know how goals are scored in football   but how about in rugby ? , If a team carries the ball over the goal line   they score points  A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch
The ball is a different shape in rugby   isn ’ t it ? , Yes  It ’ s not perfectly round like a football  A rugby ball is oval in shape  There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon  Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching
Yes   fine  I had something wrong with my stomach  I won ’ t go into detail   but it wasn ’ t serious , I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital
Well   the nurse game me plenty of painkillers   but it did feel uncomfortable  I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours  That was the worse thing , I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital
No   not at all  I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days , Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?
I think that the public transport system could be made simpler  I never know where the bus routes actually go  The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line , I think we just need to build more roads  Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams
I think we should do a few things at once  Improving public transport would encourage people to use that  If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre   they won ’ t use their cars as much , I don ’ t know  I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money  They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax   for example
That ’ s a good point  Car owners will probably be against it   but people who use public transport will be in favor of it , Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ?
The second driver was luckier  He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound , Yes  He was released from hospital yesterday evening  The other man could be there for weeks
It means he ’ s really badly injured   but he will almost certainly survive , His family will be pleased to hear that  They must have been so worried
How did it grow into such a large place ? , Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here  The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre
I see  Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? , Oh   yes  Several of the buildings from the villages still survive  Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs  There was a castle near one village   so our city has a castle too
I like basketball  I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV , Who ’ s your favourite player ?
I think they do   but I ’ m biased  They have a good manager and a great coach , I can ’ t keep up with the game  The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing
Yes   I do  We ’ re doing pretty well this season  We ’ Ve won most of our games   but we ’ re not top of the league table , How many more games are there this season ?
Not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor  I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days , What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ?
Maybe  I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either  That ’ s unusual , Well  I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again  Dr  Jameson is very good
I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight  How about you ? , Yes   I'd love to  It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good
I'm really not sure  Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony   but this year there are several contenders , You ’ re right  This year should be much more exciting than usual  What ’ s you favourite award category ?
You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau   aren ’ t you ? , Yes   I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD  I adore him  He ’ s my idol
I see  I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day  I see you also have several poster of him , Yes  These posters are new  I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday
Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? , Of course ! I bought two copies
I think they must have horrible lives  All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do  They must get sick of it , I bet they love it really  Sure   they complain about it   but that just gets them more publicity   doesn ’ t it ?
Show biz stars have plenty of expenses  That ’ s why they need so much money  They need million of dollars to buy big   seclude houses and wonderful dresses  I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt   but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like , I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars  They ’ re overpaid   over-ambitious   and over-adored
Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection , There ’ s so much I want to do  I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world  I just ran a search for music to download
When you sent your emails   did you attach any files to them ? , Yes   I did  There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments   so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone
That ’ s right  Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites  Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit , How do I do that ?
I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans , Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention  There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years
no-one really believes gossip columnists , I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns  You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said  If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly   it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines
I love children   as you know   so probably a children ’ s charity , You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity   so you ’ d really need to be very careful  Anyway   I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography
Yes   it is  Thanks  I ’ m just surfing on the internet , Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
No  you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection  There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city , So   what programs do you have on your laptop ?
It ’ s wonderful   isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? , Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?
I usually run it every few days  It finds a virus about half the time , Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?
Just a minute  go to this one  I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it  It only takes a few minutes to download  Then you have to go through the set up procedures  But they are not complicated , What do you use your computer for ?
How often do you use the internet ? , I use it almost every day   but I usually only use it to check my email  I don ’ t often surf the net  You use the internet a lot   don ’ t you ?
Yes   I like the job though  Sometimes   I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online , How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
What I do is find the website of shops  Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable , What do you think are the main causes of war today ?
Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years  It seems they will never end , How do you think they could be ended ?
It sounds easy when you say it like that  In reality   it ’ s harder to make peace between countries , Yes  It is  One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support  Wars are very expensive
would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it , I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage  The problem is that   for me   each advantage has its own disadvantage
I see what you mean  I love being far away from a city   but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities , People can ’ t have it both ways  If you live in the country   it is often less convenient  If you live in a city   it is noisy   but there ’ s more to do
The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing  There ’ s so sign of pollution  The village looks so peaceful , Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do  There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant  There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods
Not at all  I ’ m an agnostic  Do you ? , I ’ m not sure  Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?
I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually  I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong , For example ?
I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! , Why not ! It ’ s a classic  In fact   it ’ s one of my favorite novels
No   not at all , First of all   it ’ s a romance novel   set in the early 19th century
Why does he want to do that ? , Since he doesn ’ t have a son   he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man  That way   all of his daughters will be cared for
I see  This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all , So   are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ?
It would take a lot less time , How about this  When you finish the book  I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you
I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day  I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids  I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes , Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch  They don ’ t do much else in their free time  At least they always do their homework first
Sure  You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time , Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing  He watches too much Tv too
It ’ s a program about islam  It ’ s very interesting , Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?
Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life  Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith , When muslims pray   they face towards mecca
That ’ s right  That ’ s when accidents often happen  The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims   to reduce the chances of accidents , Pilgrimages are common in many faiths
I think that place is Lourdes  There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there , Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders  I play the part of the detective  He has to catch the killer   but there ’ s very little evidence  It ’ s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes   but I hope audience won ’ t be too scared to go to the movie theatres ! , Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director
Not at all  The feedback from audience has been great  I care about what they think more than what the critics think , Did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
My pleasure  Have you seen the movie yet ? , Yes  I have  I liked it very much  Like you   I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie  She ’ s going to be a star
Yes   I do  I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet , How do you find studying a language on the internet ?
Actually   many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese   so they ’ re easy for me , So   you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers   right ?
Hi   Charlie ! What are you reading ? , Hi   bob  I ’ m reading a biography ?
Who is he ? , He ’ s a famous American musician
What do you think about it ? , It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it
How many chapters does the book have ? , There are 15 chapters in total
Thanks  Charlie ! , No problem  Bob
It ’ s a thriller  It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead , I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts   so it might be interesting  I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed
The movie starts at eight o ’ clock   so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready , Good  Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go  The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results
It ’ s an article about language  It talks about the idea of having a single global language , It seems that English already is the main global language  Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language
The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost   but others will continue to be used for generation   even if English continues to be the dominant language , Right  All the people who speak Chinese  Hindi   French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages
Are you an art aficionado ? , Not really  I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year  I hardly know anything about art or sculpture  You are a true art lover   aren ’ t you ?
Art isn ’ t for everyone  I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery  It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture , I like sculpture   especially that from ancient rome or Greece  What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you
Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty  it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits , How many people are in your family ?
Not anymore  They live with my brother now  and yours ? , My parents live by themselves now  when they get older   they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home  Do you just have one brother ?
How long have you been married ? , About seven years now  and you ?
If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly   I would get a divorce , If that happens   maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws !
The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition  He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned , Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent  What did you think of it ?
I like landscapes and still life  You prefer abstract paintings   don ’ t you ? , Yes   I do  I like painters who use will rather than watercolors  The colors appear richer  What do you think ?
That would be nice  Can you read the characters ? , I know what the characters on the paintings mean  I think Chinese characters look very artistic  It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character
Sure  Let ’ s go  What are you going to have done ? , I want to have a foot massage and haircut
This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour ! , I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally  Don ’ t you agree ?
What ’ s special about a thai massage ? , That ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet
Yes   I am  I enjoyed studying it at school   though I had trouble remembering all the dates   so my teacher never gave me good marks , I love history   but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened
What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice   do they ? , The idea is that the people and dates change   but the reason why things happen stay the same
Cindy ’ s husband is Ron , How many children do Cindy and Ron have ?
Yes   they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys , Does their daughters get along well with her in-laws ?
Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family , When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill   what do you do to attract his attention ?
That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant , That ’ s what I thought  I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it  Anyway   what did you do yesterday evening ?
He seemed ok  We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal  We just waved at each other , I need to move some furniture  Could you help me to lift it ?
Do you like Barry ? , No   not very much  He ’ s too ambitious and dishonest
What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? , I think I ’ m polite   careful   relaxed and shy
You ’ re right  I love going out and making new friends , So   you ’ ll be at my birthday party on Friday ?
He ’ s 21  how old is James ? , He ’ s a year older than Keith   but he looks younger
He can spend more time with his grandchildren , Oh   I don ’ t think he wants to  He wants to travel to several different countries around the world
In the same way   probably , How do you think people get their personalities ?
No   but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in   so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot , So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents
Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? , Maybe some of it  I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly
Yes   he is  He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school  Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner  After dinner   he goes out with his friends , So   he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality  Some kids are very quiet and introverted  You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them
What time are you leaving ? , 1 thirty P  m  But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P  m
I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P  m , Ok  See you tomorrow
I ’ d like to   but there ’ s her boyfriend  He ’ s very broad-shouldered , He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that
We have different tastes  I like girls with short hair  I like tall girls - probably because I ’ m so tall myself , Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
I'm getting a bit plump myself  Perhaps I ’ ll go with you , What do you do for a living ?
Yes   I do  It ’ s very interesting  What ’ s your job ? , I ’ m a bus driver
What does she do ? , She works as a teller in a bank
Why ? What does she want to be ? , She wants to be a manager
Excuse me   sir  Could you spare a minute ? , Uh   yes
And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? , It ’ s really very good
Which train do you catch in the evening ? , I usually take the 5 thirty home
Would you agree that the service is fast ? , Yes   it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap  Fares have gone up25 %
Well   I thought I'd come to see you   so here I am , You did give me a surprise  How have you been ?
I'm sorry to hear that  Take care of yourself , It's really great to see you again  How about a drink tonight ?
OK , I'll pick you up
Fine , I haven ’ t seen you for several days
He is an accountant  I have been helping him for a week , He must be happy
Good evening  Welcome to our program , Thank you  Good evening   MrDean
Glad to meet you   MsBaker , Glad to meet you   too
What do you do for a living ? , I'm a teacher
Good morning   Miss Bell ! , Nice to see you again
Just fine   and you ? , Quite well   thank you
Did someone meet you at the airport here ? , Yes   thanks
London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look  There ’ s nelson ’ s column   built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory  He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 , I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey   where many historical figures are buried   like Isaac Newton   the great mathematician and Winston Churchill   the great wartime leader
She was a very controversial leader  Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? , There ’ s a lot to see there  Perhaps we should go tomorrow
Where ’ s that ? Oh   I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum , There you can see british leaders   entertainers   criminals   and royalty
Fine   thank you  How are you doing this morning ? , Not bad  How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time
Very much  New York is such a nice place  Shall I show you some photographs ? , Thanks   I like looking at photographs  How nice ! Oh   I'm afraid I must be going now  I've got an appointment  Have a good day
Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? , Almost  I ’ Ve put up the decorations   and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles
Yes  I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it  It won ’ t take long to make  How many people are coming to the party ? , I think everyone will be coming  Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland
Yes   I did  I send most of them a week ago  I ’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person , I did the same  I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents  I hope I didn ’ t forget to buy anyone something !
Yes  I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table  Did you find the party hats ? , Yes   I did  I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child  I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too
That birthday cake looks wonderful   but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet , Thanks for reminding me  I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too
How do you celebrate national day in your country ? , There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building
We don ’ t have a national day , Really ? That ’ s unusual
What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? , As in many countries   there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers  Young people are attracted to that field in particular  There ’ s also been a big growth in education
I noticed that too  What are the people learning ? , In my country   they are usually studying something business-related   such as marketing   management techniques   and human resource management
Those in traditional fields   such as agriculture and heavy industry  Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper , Yes  My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors   but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors  However   our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well
Not much  Joann  Do you want to hang out ? , Yes   I do  I ’ m at home myself right now with nothing much to do
I have   actually  How about the movie   Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood ? , Hmm  I ’ Ve seen that   too  We could go for a walk in the park
I ’ d really rather not  I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford ! , Ok  I guess we ’ d be not do that   either   then  What do you want to do ?
Let ’ s see  Do you want to go to a bar and sing some karaoke ? , That sounds interesting   but I can ’ t drink alcohol with the medicine I ’ m taking
Goodness   we ’ re not having much luck here   are we ? , No  do you have a car ?
That sounds great ! Have you eaten ? , Not yet  I ’ ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here
Oh   right  I suppose so  As long as you promise to lose ! , Hey  as long as I ’ m not alone on a Saturday night   I don ’ t really care what I do !
Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? , No   thank you  I had too much to drink yesterday evening  I had a bad hangover this morning  My head felt terrible
It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks  You should stick with one for the whole evening , I know   but it was a celebration   you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk
Let me buy you a soft drink then  How about a coke ? , Yeah  That ’ s a good idea  I heard that coke was first used as a medicine
Yes  I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine , and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not
Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool  I hope it ’ s safe , Don ’ t worry about them  They ’ re very responsible  Besides   there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel  Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you  So   what shall we do this evening ?
That ’ s a great idea  We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids , Now   how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day
I think you ’ re right  I think we have a very good athletics team  They should do well in the Olympics  How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? , I really don ’ t know  I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals   but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones
We might get a gold medal in the sailing too  Our team put in a lot of practice , I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total
Two  French and Spanish , And how well can you speak them ?
Well   it's not as good as my French  I can speak it reasonably well   but my written Spanish isn't very good , I see  Well   we have a lot of Spanish customers   but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here
I can speak French and German , How well can you speak them ?
No   but I'll be able to tomorrow , You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that
But everything has been so easy , Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork  Just like we planned ! That may be true   but if you were to do it   you would have trouble on the horizon  You always say that
Dalian is a beautiful city  Do you agree ? , I suppose I do
This city is really comfortable to living , It sure is
Maybe , That's for sure
But I don't even know what to study , If I had chance again   I'd major in English  You're good at language
But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun   while I spend all my time doing reading and writing , But if you go to university   you'll still have time for fun
You're right  Thank you for the advice , Are you feeling better today   Bill ?
You're right   but you know   it's hard to give up an old habit , But you should make up your mind first
Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it , What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ?
I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age   because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly , Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday
Oh   he ’ s fine  Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays , He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ?
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? , Yes   there is  Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives  They want to go out   have fun   and explore the world  They want to develop their own view of life  Parents usually try to discourage them   but they don ’ t often succeed
Have you heard of Paul ? , No   what ?
No   they made him vicepresident in charge of sells , Oh   I don't believe it  He is only being with the company for two years
Have you heard about Anlesen David ? , No   have they have another fight ?
Well   my dear  I didn't believe either  But got it straight form the horse's mouth  David called me this morning , So when did all this happen ?
Next June , I can hardly believe it
You don't think you could be wrong ? , I'am absolutely sure I'm right
You're hundred percent sure you want to eat here ? , Check and double check
I don ’ t think you ’ re right there , I believe industry is making us wealthier
I agree with you in the sense  But we ’ re all more miserable than ever   aren ’ t we ? , I don ’ t agree with you  I maintain that we ’ re healthier   wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago
Yes  I dare say it will be , It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed
Mmm   you may be right , Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ?
It will be summer  So it will be hot , Is that very likely in England ?
What do you mean ? , Roman is living in Rome   of course  And go to work by car   or bus   or on foot
And Roman really loves life  He knows how to enjoy himself , Not always  But they like good meal
By air of course , Hi   Mr  James   what ’ s the rush ?
Thanks  But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set , Can I help you in anyway ?
Sam   what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? , There ’ s a possibility
Is that so ? , Absolutely  Take my word for it
Oh   what ’ s the matter ? , I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache
Well   it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor , Yeah   I guess I should
Bye , Lisa   I ’ Ve been thinking of something
Do you mean you want to sell up your company of your own ? , There ’ s a possibility  What do you say ?
Nowadays   they offer so many services   you hardly know which one to choose  Take mailing for example  Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? , I save money in a post office saving account  There used to be just one kind of account   but now there are several  They each have different conditions and interest rates
My son likes going to the main post office  They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection , Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ?
How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet , Oh   it was great  We had seafood buffet  They do one every Friday  The waiters and waitresses are very good  They are very attentive   but don ’ t hang around the table
Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage   but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ”  what was included in the seafood buffet ? , They had almost every kind of seafood  There were oyster   shrimp   prawns   crabs   and fish  I ate a lot of smoked salmon
Yes   it probably is  I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants  You never know whether they are fresh , I know  I didn ’ t eat any   but a few people in our group did and no one got sick
Oh   you don ’ t usually have a starter ? , No   I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day
I took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary , That ’ s a good idea  You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job
That ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too  It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire , Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ?
Well   they look lovely   but they ’ re not very practical  I mean   would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? , I know what you mean  People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation  I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties
You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? , Yes  I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think  In a way   the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think  Wear what you like ! ’
Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? , I use several services  Of course   I deposit and withdraw money quite often  I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account  I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another  I often travel abroad   you see
Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit , Yes   I do  It save me a lot of time  I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines
I have a deposit account with my bank  There are some restrictions on withdrawing money   but the interest rate is much higher , I don ’ t have one  I prefer to buy shares  My bank also provides a share trading service  It ’ s cheap and easy to use
I think so  Blue is still very fashionable at the moment , This style came out last year   though  I like the dress   but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year
There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes , I wish I could be one of those people   but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far  I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy

How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn , I checked it out of the rental library  It only costs five cents a day
If it's any good   I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition , Do you know much about computers ?
For accounting system and things like that   you mean ? , Yes   but they are used for other things   too  Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris
Of course   his machine must have been connected to a computer , That's right

How can I lose weight   doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? , Well   Jim  It is a combination of how much you eat   the type of food you eat   and when you eat your meals

Good  If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong , Say   Jim   how about going for a few beers after dinner ?
Do you really think so ? I don't  It will just make us fat and act silly  Remember last time ? , I guess you are right  But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home
Sounds great to me ! If they are willing   we could ask them to go dancing with us  That is excellent exercise and fun   too , Good  Let's go now
You did ? that is great ! , Yeah   I am having a party this saturday night   a sort of house warming   and i want to invite you  are you busy ?

Wow   all this for forty dollars per month ? , That ’ s right   plus the activation fee   the emergency services fee   the monthly service fee   oh   and any charges for extra minutes   and

Well   you certainly match those criteria   but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone  What does it say about me ? , A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical  She likes to do things in conventional ways  That sounds just like you !
No   no   a friend of mine taught me this really fun game  I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face   and you guess who it is ! , OK !
Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK   my turn  He has a crooked nose and full lips  He has quite a few freckles and an oval face  Oh   he is also bald ! , Your future husband !
What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? , Mumm  no
The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs  South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players  I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country   and all , I have no idea what you ’ re talking about  The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl
Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team   hoping they will become the next champion  So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! , All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down   trying to get a free kick or penalty kick  It seems like a sissy sport to me !
Mine was ok   except that no one in my class speaks English  I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester , That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate  It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans   a Pole   a Scottish   two French   an American   a Brazilian   a Chilean   a New Zealander   though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi  Who else do we have ? Oh   we also have a Moroccan   a Togolese   a Pakistani   and two Indonesians !
I guess so   but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates   especially with the language barrier  I think I might change classes , Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful  I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice
Oh   George   what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing , It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids   put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp  Here   Mary   help me lay down these beach towels
And stay in the shallow area  I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier , You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold   huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret  Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there  Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows
Trina   will you marry me ? , Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared   of course I ’ ll marry you !
She what ? , Oh don ’ t worry   sweetie   I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose  It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying   I ’ Ve got it all planned out  There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending
Ah , And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us  I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night  though they might have to tone it down a bit  Or we could hire a DJ  Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings  what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine  And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh   your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake !
If I survive the next six months , Joanne   let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is   okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly   so we can go our separate ways   alright ?
Nothing ! Anyway   you ’ re right   there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty  My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property   as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog  So that ’ s done  finally , Let ’ s not go there   Joanne ! Ok   so let ’ s start with the record collection   I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back
He ’ s my grandfather   and he never really liked you anyway ! , Whatever ! Alright   I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone   if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set
Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day  We were going to visit the Trev fountain   and we got caught in the rain , and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet  I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley   smiling and laughing in the rain
Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle , The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine !
I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for  I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write  I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally  And you know I can be charming in interviews  Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! , Ben   we ’ re fifteen  What kind of job are you looking for ?
But I ’ m just in it for the money   right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides   I love the smell of gasoline   don ’ t you ? , Now that it ’ s the new year   I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf
So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? , Well   first of all   I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking  It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything   it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen   and I think it ’ s time to stop
It ’ s about time ! , Bill  Bill ! You gotta help me !
Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall   window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like , That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people
Yeah   tell me about it  I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish   right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod , Now that ’ s a great idea !
That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan   get some investors and start working for myself ! , Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
Well   that seems easy enough , Wait   there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services  What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part   a market analysis  You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage   where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea
Umm  I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! , Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
I see  That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this   such as GMT  I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! , That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time  Here in California   we are in Pacific Standard Time   that is eight time zones west of Greenwich  Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well   then we were in China Standard Time   and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
I ’ Ve been playing computer games , What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ?
My laptop is on my bed  If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me , Fine !
Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! , Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple !
Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games   get him some gag gifts and just have a good time  Nothing too over the top , Well   I don ’ t know
Man   I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! , Whoa   whoa   take it easy   relax  Geez   you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ?
I know  I know ! , Let ’ s think this through  First of all   you cannot leave Amy at the altar  Not only will she be humiliated and kill you   but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all   you are just getting cold feet  You know deep down inside that you want to marry her   so cut the crap and do it !
Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious , Yeah   I'm OK   I have been having a lot of mood swings lately  I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones
Well   maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident   brave and hopeful ! , I hope you are right
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market , Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible   they are just urban legends  They are just stories people make up to scare you
Well maybe you are right   but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! , Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true   don't you think ?
Yeah   my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid  I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding   but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles , You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight  I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong
So you are saying that I should eat   but I should just watch what I eat ? , Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol  You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish
Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family , Why would that be funny ?
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary , I don ’ t agree   but anyways   I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself
What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in , Well   I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday !
I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate  Fresh start to accomplish any dreams   objectives and goals , Do you have a New Year's resolution ?
That seems reasonable  We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square , Sure   as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight !
I can't sleep , But it's almost midnight !
Well   I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings   so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies  I even left out some milk  I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies   so I came downstairs ! , Hmm  well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree   spying on him !
O-K , Hey   honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some   too !
Well   I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! , Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house  I think most of the times they are just scam artists
Hey Michelle   jump in quick  It's pouring out there ! , Oh   hi Melissa  Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr  Campbell
Ah thank you ! I'm very excited  We were going to get married next year   but then we decided to get married on holiday instead  It was wonderful , That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year   but we had to postpone our plans  We just don't have the money !
Definitely  Oh   there's Mr  Campbell  Driver   can you stop here please ? , Honey   I ’ ll be right back !
Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly   why do you need a manicure every week ? , Well   first of all   I like to pamper myself   and my nails look great  You should come with me !
Yeah   sounds like something I should definitely do , Hey Michelle  Good to see you  Are you at lunch ?
Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? , My first time  I've traveled around Europe a lot   but this was my first time to Spain  It was amazing   and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain   and just sun   sun   sun
Ah   Michelle   hi  I was hoping to see you  How have you been ? How's the family ? , Oh   hello   Mr  Campbell  I'm fine and Jack's doing well  How are you ?
Good   well we can discuss this more then   but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter , Yes   me too
Not much really  It's more of an American tradition   so back home we don't really celebrate it  In fact   I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! , Well you know   it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything !
And then what did happen ? , Well   they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives   giving thanks the land   and everyone for the foods   healthy and new lives
Count me in ! , Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night  Are you OK ?
I was  It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare  I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home   like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family , Yeah   it can get pretty lonely over the holidays  When I first got here   I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home  I almost let it get to me   but then I started going out   keeping myself busy and before I knew it   I was used to to it
You know   I could really go for that  You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? , Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out  well kinda
Yeah of course ! Although   don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? , What do you mean ?
Like for example   if I hadn ’ t studied architecture   I would have become an artist like I wanted to , I see  Yeah now that I think of it   I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally
I ’ ll drink to that ! , Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !
Well   to begin with   Gambling is addictive   ruins marriages   destroys families and bankrupts communities  Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop  People have lost their houses   cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted  Secondly   it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk  Women gamble to escape   and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction  Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies , Geez ! Now that I think about it   maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although   I have been to Las Vegas   and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that
Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something   they should do it on civil rights , Yes   but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable   defenseless   and are completely at the mercy of human beings
Well   you are right on that point  This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products , At least you ’ re doing your part  My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family
Do you already know how to play an instrument ? , Uh  Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums  Now that I know how to play well   I would like to form a rock band
Yes   I ’ m a singer , Perfect  So you can audition this weekend here at my house
Carrie   are you ok ? You seem a bit down , I just got off the phone with my boyfriend  He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing  It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times
Men are like that you knowThey can feel nervous   anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness , I guess you are right  What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know
Tom   aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or-treating ? , What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ?
Wow   that terrible movie is finally over  Next time I ’ m picking the film   because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick , Well you should have picked   in the end you always complain about everything
I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage , You see   that ’ s what I ’ m talking about   I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore
Love stories ? More like one-night-stands , Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat   drunk friends of yours   they ’ re no saints
Honey   do you have a second ? , Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worriedWhat ’ s on your mind ?
I ’ Ve been thinking   and well   I think we need to start seeing other people , What ? Why ? I mean   we ’ Ve had our ups and downs   and we have the occasional disagreement   but we ’ re happy together   aren ’ t we ?
Tim   you are too good for me  You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy  Oh   I could say that I ’ ll be all you need   but that would be a lie  I know I ’ d only hurt you   I know I ’ d only make you cry , Baby   come on  Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is   we can work it out  Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this   but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me
Here are your keys  I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week  I ’ m sorry   Tim  I wish you all the best   and I hope that one day we can meet again  I ’ ll always love you  Goodbye , Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ?
I wanted to   but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place , Right on   right on ! Well   Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread   but Sherry paid for everything
Alright everyone settle down  Let ’ s get startedAs you know   an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system  It is not enough to simply memorize our laws   it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed  This brings me to our topic for today  Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? , Cinct de mayo ?
No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US   but in other countries it is , Www   man !
Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high priceOn May third   1886   police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory   killing four and wounding many  A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality , And then what happened ?
Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay   my turn  What would you do if you won the lottery ? , Let ’ s see  If I won the lottery   I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world
Alright this is a good one  What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? , If I told her that   she would faint and have me committed !
I liked physics  It ’ s all math   really   arcs   curves   velocity   cool stuff , Yeah   yeah   but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe
Turtles ? Whatever  Look   all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles  At least   that ’ s what the math says , Math   sheath  What ’ s the evidence ?
Dude   don ’ t equivocate  A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing  You slept through class   didn ’ t you ? , Where to   miss ?
From China , Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me   if you don ’ t mind me saying so
Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? , Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !
Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? , Uh  yeah  of course !
Sure   honey   we ’ re talking now   aren ’ t we ? , You know what I mean
You know   I think you ’ re awesome , I ’ m awesome  Well   I guess that ’ s my answer   isn ’ t it
Baby   I love you so much , You do ?
Come on  Put the gun down , Oh baby   I ’ m so sorry
Things doing great ! It ’ s funny running into you like this  Smell well   just last week I ran into Matt as well , Yeah ? How ’ s he doing ?
Well   we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing   talking about work and family   when all of a sudden   Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out   and screaming , Ha ha   really ?
Howdy folks   and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know   Rick   today is a key game between Russia and Canada  As you know   the winner will move on to the finals , That ’ s right   and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match  The ref is calling the players for the face-off  and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards !
What an amazing goal ! , Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time !
Ha ha   come on ! Well   I ’ Ve been watching what I eat   and working out three times a week  By the way   I heard your son recently graduated ! , Yes   my little Paul is finally a doctor  They grow up so fast you know
Oh yes  She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended , Such a lovely girl  I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
That would be great ! Give me a call ! , See you soon ! Bye ! Egg  I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter
Okay   now you really have to fill me in  What ’ s he like ? , He ’ s really good looking   he ’ s quite tall   around 6 ’ 1 ”   he ’ s in his early thirties   and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes
Hold on a sec   his name is David ? , Yeah ?
And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits   right ? , Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat   no more chips   no more soda   no more fried food
Well   I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see , Thanks   honey   that was a great meal  I ’ m stuffed  Do we have any chips left ?
Who's winning ? , The Bulls   of course !
You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot ! , That was a great shot ! A three pointer   yeah !
Okay  end of the first quarter  Alright   I ’ m gonna make a beer run , Nick ! How ’ s it going ?
Actually   my office is right around the corner , It was great to meet you last week at the conference  I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment
You know what   this is really embarrassing   but your name has just slipped my mind  Can you remind me ? , Sure   my name is Ana Ferris  Don ’ t worry about it   it happens to me all the time  I ’ m terrible with names too
Come on   Dad   I need thirty thousand  I wanna get into the market  You know   I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn   the inevitable recession   people stuffing their money in their mattresses  I look at this as an opportunity  This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg , I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now   it would be a very unwise decision to invest  I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son   but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently  There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months   and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy  There ’ s just too much instability  I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate
Fine   then ! If that ’ s the way you feel   so be it  But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here  I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash , I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married !
Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? , That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer  I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew  Oh   they look so cute !
Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? , This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest  I hope you like western cooking
It's excellent , Thank you for your compliment  Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it
I like beefsteak very much  Have you tried Chinese dishes ? , I find the Chinese dishes wonderful
Good morning   Mary ! , Good morning   John !
Yes   if that's all right for you , I'm pretty sure I'll be all right  In fact   I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you  What time are you planning to start ?
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me , What's that ?
No   thank you , That's the most important thing
When you lent me the bike   it looked brand new   almost anyway , Maybe   but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well
A friend and I are planing to go out   why ? what's up ? , There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum   I was hoping you ' d like to come with me
I wish I could   but it's my mums birthday , Maybe next week
I am really sorry too   maybe I can give you a call sometime , I heard that ben is forming his own band
I can play drums   but I haven ’ t played for a while  I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band , I wish I could play a musical instrument  I love music
You know   you could probably get a computer program that would help you  You already have a computer   so you could use that to help you mix some music , That ’ s a great idea  I ’ ll search for some information on the internet  If it ’ s possible to do   the internet will have some information about it
What's wrong ? , It won't start
Well   if you change your mind   let me know , I will  Thanks  That's sweet of you
Sure  I have all kinds of tools  Just ask  I ’ ll be happy to get them for you , Thanks  That would be very helpful
Hello   Kevin  I hate to do this   but I have to cancel our appointment , Oh   no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place
I should have some free time next week  Say   next Wednesday evening ? , That's good for me   but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you
OK , Hi   Alice   what are you doing this sunday ?
Sounds great   I'd very much like to accept your invitation   thanks   when ? , Around six pm
Ok   I will see you then , Great   have a good day   thanks again for the offer
Well   Rose , Is there something any need ?
Great   Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? , I beg your pardon ?
Is 5 PM  Saturday a good time for you ? , Hmm   how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner
I'll be there on time , What kind of music do you like listening to ?
I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music  It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music , Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain  Research suggest that it makes your brain more active  Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better
I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s  I should follow your lead and increase my brian power , You can find plenty of recording on the internet too  You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them
Are you ready to go to the bank ? , Sure   what do you need to do there ?
that ’ s right  You ’ re going away next week , I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account  There was a problem last week
I heard that Janet has got a new job  She ’ s working for the united investment group  I heard that they pay very well , I heard that too  She must be making a pocket  Well   good for her
You ’ re right  By the way   did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently ? , Really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago
He said that he would probably invest most of it  He ’ s got a well-paid job   so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses  He just wants some extra money available for when he retires , I had some good financial news yesterday too
It certainly was ! So   what are you going to do with your windfall ? , Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?
You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer  I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night , There must have been some good news in the newspaper  I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited
Well   they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment , I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that
Hello ! Let me introduce myself  My name is Nancy , Nice to meet you   I'am Seven  I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before

Good , May I know what you do ?
Thank you , Oh   God  It ’ s late  I ’ m afraid I have to leave
That ’ s too bad , Thank you for your hospitality
Great idea  I ’ m looking forward to it  See you then , Well  I really do have to go
Hi   Martin  I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning , What ’ s up ?
Yes , Congratulations ! Susan  I ’ m so happy for you
Me too  I ’ ll write to you once I get settled  But I have so much to do  You might have to wait a while  But I really will write to you  I love to write letters  I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call , Ok  Take care  Have a nice journey
Bye , I want to say goodbye to everyone
How about I come and see you off ? , You really don ’ t need to
You ’ re welcome , Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me
Of course  I will , Goodbye   then  Thanks again for everything
I see  What is that ratio exactly ? , It ’ s approximately 314   but the number continues forever  What ’ s the diameter of your circle ?
According to the newspaper   the exchange rate is 185 dollars to the pound , That means that 10000 pounds will buy me 18500 dollars
I can help you there  Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers   apart from the number itself and 1   together , So   1 2 and 3 are prime numbers   but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4
You ’ ll be a mathematician one day , What ’ s the area of your country ?
There are about 30 million people in my country  Most of them live in the north , What ’ s the average income ?
I think we are richer than most countries   but not as rich as countries in western Europe  Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment   which is roughly 8 %  It has doubled over the last four years , Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that
No   thank you  I can ’ t , It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early
That would be great ! Actually   can I get your phone number   Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime , Anytime  You can reach me 5558929
It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon , I hope so   too  Bye ! Ben
It's been a long time ! What's new ? , Nothing much  What about you ? Is everything going well ?
I had a good time  You seem to be in a hurry  Don't let me hold you up , Sorry   I've got a meeting in half an hour
Yes   stay in touch  Bye ! , Give me your email   would you ?
There ’ s some   but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem  A lot of it is petty crime   burglary and car theft  There ’ s very little major crime , It ’ s the same in my city  We also have a lot of drug addicts  A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs
I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly  If most people have similar amounts of money   they will not think of stealing from others , That ’ s possible   but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that
How would you solve the problem ? , I have a good idea to solve it  The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes
It ’ s not a bad idea  I think education is the biggest problem at the moment  Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly , If we are to invest more money to education   we will need to raise taxes  That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters
Yes  The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly , There are so many environment problems in the world today  Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?
Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term   rather than the long term  It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests  Countries and companies just want the wood  They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests  We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life , In other parts of the world   especially in Africa   there is a problem with desertification  Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert  In means that people cannot grow enough food
I think I ’ d like to do that  I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies , I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning
I know  I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm  It was pouring with rain all afternoon , We really have some movable weather sometime  I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round
The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like  Our weather is so changeable , Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine
Water is rationed  We can only use a certain amount each month  It means that we cannot use some modern household items   like washing machines  They use too much water , I see  I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution
The problem is now on a truly global scale  I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it , I think you ’ re right  There needs to be an international response to this problem
Does it ever rain in summer ? , We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks   but apart from that   summers are dry  Thunderstorms make the air fresh again   so most people don ’ t mind then
Well   I live in the southern hemisphere   so our summertime is your wintertime   and vice versa  We get some rain in every season   but most is in winter  In winter   it sometimes gets cold   but our winters are usually quite mild  Summers are warm   but not hot  Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each  The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city , Do you usually go on a summer holiday ?
What's the weather like in your city ? , In the summer it gets very hot  The temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade  When it is hot we often get rains  The winters are drier
In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that  The streets are often icing in the morning  With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms , Yeah   we do  In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon  I heard your city has a lot of fog   is that true ?
Have you ever had snow in your city ? , My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child  But my parents and I never see it outside of my city
What book is that ? , I just bought a new atlas  I ’ m looking this map of the world  Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country
Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia  European countries are relatively small  France looks quite big in Europe   but compared to many countries in other continents   it ’ s not very large at all , Britain is half the size of france   but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world
It is  It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world   with brief descriptions of how they were build   their purpose   and so on , There are the pymeids  It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though
Yes  Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape , Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top  They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical
It says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings , Is that building a perfect cube ?
What do you do in summer ? , I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride  I love being out in the fresh summer air  How about you ?
Well   I play sports indoors quite often  If I ’ m feeling lazy   I just watch a film at home  I prefer summer to winter , I think most people do  I like wearing nice   colorful clothes in summer   you know   a nice dress or skirt  It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter
Thanks to global warming   it could be hotter than ever ! , How do you usually spend your time   now that you ’ Ve retired ?
I usually have cereal   but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast , that sounds nice  How do you spend your mornings ?
I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies  I spend winter evening watching tv   but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time , Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ?
The summers are hotter  The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years  There have also been stronger winds , I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment
Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? , There are a few stories about natural disasters  There is a massive forest fire in Australia  It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers
What is the international community doing to help ? , The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies  Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies  Refugee camps have been set up across the region
I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran , Yes  There have been a few there recently  They say that this one was not a big quake  The Iranians are dealing with it on their own  They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble
Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ? , There is some   but my country is not amongst the leading producers  The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country  Your country is a big oil producer   isn ’ t it ?
No coal has been discovered in my country   but there may be undiscovered deposits  We don ’ t have many metal deposits , There are a few in my country  We have deposit of gold   but they are very small
You have many trees in your country  That ’ s another natural resources , It ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use  Government policy is to conserve those forests
We have some inspections   but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil  There has been some damage   but it is under control , Does your country export a lot of natural resources ?
We import a little oil from Venezuela   but we are fairly self-sufficient  We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries , I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone
Yes  We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones , How long will it take us to drive to London ?
You ’ re right  We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey   because we will be in built-up area , So   shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
I think it ’ s over five meters long  I can ’ t remember exactly  It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour , Wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway
Most people like football  More boys like football than girls  A few girls play it really well  Some people like playing basketball , Do many people like tennis ?
Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people  Several people from my university enjoy them   but most of us just watch  No one I know plays golf , I know loads of people who play it regularly  There are plenty of golf courses around the country  In the past   only a tiny number of people played
How are the children doing at sport ? , I ’ m very pleased with their performances  Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds  That ’ s very fast for a kid his age
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? , The longest race we run is the 1500 meters  A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters , I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !
hi   Meally   do you know that guy over there ? , The tall one ? Sure   that's Drive   he works with Lily
Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? , Well   he has already taken you know   that's his wife right there
Well   drop by if you can , I will   do you want me to bring anything ?
Sure   When is good time for you ? , Can you make it on Tuesday ?
All right   It's a date , Do you mind if I come over to use your computer ?
You got it ! , Hi   Mark   did you catch the game last night ?
Oh   really ? So   Spain is through to the next round ? , Yeah  The final is next week  You have to watch it
Not really  I'm expected to attend a meeting , I'm not at all convinced  Tomorrow is Saturday !

Yes  So you'd better dress warmly before you go out , I will  Thanks for telling me

Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ? , Yes   it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet   and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him
Going to the cafeteria ? , No   I am not eating there anymore  I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner  The food served in the cafeteria is not my type  I am a total meat lover  But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian  They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days  Haven ’ t you noticed that ?
Can you name some festivals of religious nature ? , Yes   such as Christmas and Easter

Also some traditional Chinese food   like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality  I heard this year   the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control  For sure all the customers will benefit from this , How are you making out ?

Everyone wants to be financial lose kill  You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich  I ’ m thinking about buying stocks  It can be a good investment if I can manage well  What do you say ? , I partly agree with you  Buying stocks is not difficult   but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult  Even professionals don ’ t find it easy   so be careful  Anyway   people like us need help with investing  Why not do some online research ? There are data   reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest  In addition   you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts
When it comes to select a fund   you will always read “ Past performance is not an indication of future results ”   can you believe that ? , Maybe it is right since everything is possible  You know the market changes quickly these days  But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance  For me   his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy  I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns
I will think about it , Shakespeare was born in 1867
1564 , I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year   what do you say ?

I will think about it , Come on ! It is really a fun game
I don't think soThere ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese , You're quite rightBut many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes

Not badWe have had a big meeting today   remember ? , Oh   yea  I forgotSo how did it go ?
Well   I have to write the proposal  I'm pretty excited about it , How long have you been in Taiwan ?
Providence   Rhode Island  do you know it ? , I am not sure   where exactly is it ?
So   Is this your first time to TAIWAN ? , No   I first came here 1995
Oh   I am so sorry , That ' ok  That's happens all the time
Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? , About 18 years   I started learning when I was a kid
Well   I collect beer mats  I ’ m not sure that counts   though , Hi   Sandra  how was your weekend ?
Really good ! you should try it sometime , I might  what did you do yesterday ?
Well   I go to the gym a lot  I am a member of a gym nearby , Yeah   how often do you go ?
Not really  I ’ d really like to try golf   though , The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50
No way   if it still has 21 , I think I'm going to China this vacationHow about you ?
Oh   really ? I went to China last winter ! , It seems a glorious day today
Just now we both thought it would be fine , Show us our itineraries   please
At least 20 days , They must be your parents   what do they do ?
No   usually they're very busy , When do you go to bed usually ?
Sure , Hey Kevin   what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?
Nothing that serious  She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend , And your parents took it badly ?
She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend   how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody   and so on  My dad said she's too young to do this   and that she should move out right away , How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
What do you mean ? , Well   these days too many people are getting divorced  If they live together   then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not
Doctor Butcher , What a horrible name ! Is it full of suspense ?
Yes I do   usually , What do you exactly mean by usually ?
I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing  I also wonder who reads them  Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself , It looks as though everyone in line reads them   or at least looks at the headlines
I ’ m glad  We have only about twenty things here   and I ’ m in a hurry to get home , What's your favorite TV Program ?
I prefer a variety show without a host , I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day  Their offices were very impressive   especially their company Logo which is all over the place  There are Logo models in metal   copper   clove   paper  They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights  It is really decorated identity
Wow   I doubt that , Do you take a bus to and from work ?
Oh   yeah   it ’ s terrible  I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China  It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus   and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt , That sounds terrible the way you describe it  But you know   not long ago I really suffered on the bus
Hmm  Good exercise   uh ? , Yeah   absolutely !
What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy , You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?
Oh   definitely  I remember   when I first arrived in Guangzhou   my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone , Oh   yeah  Many Chinese like to bargain  It happens almost everywhere
I am not exaggerating at all  I ’ m telling you the truth  That was how I felt at that time , Yes   perhaps  Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing  Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us
Oh   it ’ s almost eleven twenty , Thank you
I have one  We could share it  Which way are you going ? , Oh   that ’ s very kind of you  I am going to the Garden Hotel
You are married to a foreigner   huh ? So what ’ s it like ? , Well   the first year of our marriage   we had great difficulty getting along  The things that are important to me are not important to him  We had a lot of conflicts
Oh   so he ’ s half Chinese and half American  That ’ s unusual  What languages does he speak   then ? , Right now he speaks mostly Chinese   and he can say a few English words  But he will learn
I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference  Is that right ? , Yes   it would be my first trip overseas  Actually   it's going to be my first time leaving the country
Well   being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity  Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? , Yes   it wasn't too hard to get  All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee
If your flight is leaving so early   I can take you to the airport and see you off  I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 , That would be great ! Thanks a lot !
Is it worth seeing ? , Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works
Maybe so   but it seems kind of strange   which the rest of us in white shirts   dark suites   and ties , It's not as bad as that  We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers  Besides   didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ?
Even if our company didn't have a dress code   I still think people would wear formal clothing to work , I wouldn't be so sure  People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in
It's not as simple as that  People judge you by your appearance   whether you like it or not  So dressing professional is being professional  The image that you portray to others is so important in business  It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale , Maybe you're right   but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
You only say that because you don't have to work with himThe people in your department seem so capable and nice to be aroundTake Mary for exampleShe ' s smart and enthusiastic  I've never met anyone as cheery as she is , Everybody has their strengths and weaknessesEven LarryHe might be a pain to be around   but he's also very good at staying in budget on projectsMary   on the other hand   spends our project money like there's no tomorrowAlso   she's never willing to stay a little later at the officeShe always leaves at 5pm sharp
Maybe that's why he's so nice ! , Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ?
I think it's a very complicated issue  A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers  Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system  Men have power   so it's easier for them to stay in power , What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ?
I'm Patti WhitneyIsn ' t this convention great ? , Yes it is   better than I expected it would beThe presenters have been first rateIs this the first conference you've been to ?
I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles , Wow  I really like California  the weather there is much better than the East Coast
How many kids do you have ? , Two   a boy and a girlThey ’ re already grown now
No   that's okay   I already have a cokeWhy don't you have a seat   you look like you've been on your feet all day , I guess I could take a breakSo   how do you like Denver ?
What do you do for a living ? , I manage one of the ski lodgesIt ' s a great job   I can spend a lot of my time outdoors   and I also get to ski for free all season
Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized   so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field , Yes   we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union  Mostly people are pretty happy about it  I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force
Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets  Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today   and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees , Wow   sounds chaotic  two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans  What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ?
They want raises and medical insurance   and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards  That's probably the most important issue , For our lunch meeting with the investors   do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ?
Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? , Yes   we'll start with appetizers   follow with a soup and salad course   then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken   and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort
With your prime rib and chicken choices   you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian , We can make some special arrangement if we need to  After all   it's the company who is footing the bill
Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike , It happens quite often   actuallyWhenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group   the first thing they do is to call a strike  Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again  Anyhow   it's a nice   unanticipated holiday
It's not just about the things that you learn   you know  seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation  You can learn a few things   but more importantly   you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future  The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway , I'm still not too jazzed about going  I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations
What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? , Yeah   I really got a lot of the session  The workshop topic was resolving personal problems  It was led by a professional human resources director  The teacher had a lot of experience   and I think we were all given a really good base to start with
Sounds like you really learned a lot , I did  I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared
I think that's an important part of it all  we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss  We can see what they're like as real human beings   working together on some project   for fun  I really think it helped our team jell together better , Yeah   I guess you're right  I think the trust game was my favorite  I think in order to have a strong team   we've all got to learn how to trust each other more
Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress   don't you think ? , Actually   I don't think so  Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace  They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees  If there is no one to keep an eye on us   no one would get any work done  You know what they say   when the cat's away   the mice play
At their last meeting   the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore  All the executive committee was in favor of the merger  I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans , If they all unite on a certain issue   it's the stockholders who have the final say  You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers   but in fact   the stockholders control the money so they have the most power
I guess I'd buy that , Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here  The meeting is set to start at 9 am
Oh   that's right  Well   the train shouldn't be late  That means there is only one explanation  Bill must have overslept , Well   to be fare   since he's coming all the way from Lancaster   he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us  He must get start on his commute about six thirty   no telling what time he actually gets up
It's too difficult to park your car in the city  Also   the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare , So who does he think he is   anyway   I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately   I mean   it's now like he is the CEO   or anything
No kidding ! When the last CEO left   we were worried about the future of the company , What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company   but what does he actually do ?
How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ? , Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter  It's nice to see some improvement for a change
Why would you say that ? , They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan  There are a lot of cultural differences to account for
Sure ! I just got back yesterday  I'm still suffering from jet lag , How can I tell her about this ?
How can you live without job in the future ? , Don't worry   you'll find a way
Don't worry   do it step by step , Why can I learn it ?
Such bad luck   200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today , Don't be angry   you lose money just to avoid misfortune
No   it's not , She doesn't look like our classmate
Come on   Tara  Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets  The movie is starting in a few minutes , We can ’ t break into the line  Don ’ t be so impatient  We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon
I ’ m looking forward to this film  I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper , Me   too  It will be great to see something light and funny for a change  I ’ m tired of heavy drama
How are you getting along with your wife now ? , What can you expect ? Not that good
How are your work now ? , Not bad   just let it go
That sounds about right to me   fifty cents a bag  If they think you don ’ t know better   they ’ ll try to get more , It ’ s the same in Balloon  But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver  The fare was twenty dollars   and you gave him a five-dollar tip  That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much !
Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill   so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra , Well   I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week   and they did not even call us in advance
Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? , Yes   but Americans never visit without calling in advance   and they almost never stay overnight
Frank   I want your advice on something  Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party  Actually   they called it an informal get-together , And what ’ s the problem ?
Well   last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party   but I was overdressed  I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt   blouse   scarf   and medium heels  you know , That sounds just right to me  What was wrong with it ?
Sally   I ’ m tired of this Western food  I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking , I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking  But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ?
It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs   do not take naps during the day   and yet they can be so heavy , You see   because we are often busy working   we eat too much fast food   and that food is very fattening
Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting   but it didn't look like real rice to me , It wasn't  It was birdseed  We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it
She ’ s got quite a crowd around her  Oh   look ! That little girl caught it ! , She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece  I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time
It ’ s all right , I was caught in the heavy rain   or I would have come earlier  I am sorry I kept you waiting
I totally understand , Come in   come in !
Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven  Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment , I ’ m sorry  We must have misunderstood each other
It ’ s okay  I don ’ t want to go now  We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie  I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning , Darling   I have news for you  Bobby and his wife   Evelyn   are going to have a baby soon
Oh   what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it  He likes children and always wants a child of his own , In fact   they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby  Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like   since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese
Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact   isn ’ t it ? , So Chris   I've heard that you're from a big family  How many people ?
Well   my mother came from a big family   and wanted to have one of her own  My father was an only child   and didn't really care about having a large family   but my mother talked him into it , Jeez   seven children  That must have a lot of problems  We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right
That's one  Another is the lack of personal property  Everything you have   from toys to clothes   is used by your brothers and sisters  Especially clothes  Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs , And the age gap is also annoying  There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me  We have nothing in common
Don ’ t mention it  It ’ s my pleasure  Have you been to one of these large   sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? , No   this is my firstLast week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home  I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be lateBut I was the first one
I was late getting back from the mall   but I ’ m hurrying , Why are you in such a hurry ? They said   Dinner at eight   and it ’ s only seven-fifteen  I don ’ t want to be the first one there again
Huh ? , I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ?
Actually   I ’ d forgotten about it , Forgotten about it ? How could you ?
It ’ s all right  There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian , I guess so  So what do you do around this time of year ?
Not at all  A party is a party  I ’ ll be happy to come , Thank you for showing me your offices   Mr  Becker  I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs
Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives  Government service can be a rewarding and secure career , Do you mean financially rewarding ?
Sometimes that ’ s true   but not usually  Most feds are honest   hard-working professionals  It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people   so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive , How much do you make ?
I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime , No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently  Where did you spend your holidays ?
Yes  We enjoyed ourselves very much  Have you traveled much   Luke ? , No   my wife doesn ’ t like traveling  We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years  The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married  We spent our honeymoon in the Alps
I said   I ’ m Ted   who are you ? , Huh ? Oh   my name is Laura
Let ’ s go outside and talk  So Laura   do you come here often ? , Hold on   my ears are still ringing from the music  what was it you asked me ?
No   this is my first time here , I usually come with a group of friends  We dance a little   have a few drinks   and just have a good time
I guess so  But the music is too loud  I don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people   but next time I ’ ll do it in a park , Anita   I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already
Las Vegas  I find gambling relaxing  I don ’ t take it seriously   the way some people do  Besides   I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town  The casinos never close   you know , If you gamble all night   you ’ ll run out of money in a few days
To tell you the truth   sometimes I regret having a baby so early  I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby , I understand  I was in your position before  At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me  My husband seldom stayed at home
I see  So if my little family goes to America   I would end up taking care of my child all the time  My husband would have to make the bread for us  I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day , Don ’ t worry  You can take night classes  I did that when I had kids  And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten  Then you could find a job and work
So   where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? , Oh   I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand
You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then   how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her , That ’ s true  But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now  Actually we are on an intimate level  We even plan to be engaged next month
Probably you ’ re right , Lili   let ’ s take a vacation !
Where will we sleep   then ? , In the van
Maybe you ’ re right  When do you plan to go ? , The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait !
Let ’ s go to ChicagoWe can have lunch in ChinatownThen we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! , You have such good ideas !
Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years   and now you have a job working with your hands ! , Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge   and creativity  I love this job
Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude , I can ’ t wait to retire
That sounds boring to me , What do you plan on doing after you retire ?
How good are you at sports   Bill ? , Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports  I go to football or baseball games a lot  And I read sports magazines every week
Oh   yes  I like to exercise  But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines  I don ’ t have much time to do those things , Oh   I see  You know   we spend time doing different sports  How much time do you spend exercising ?
Well   why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult   but very rewarding , Oh   I ’ m too lazy to play sports   and I ’ m not good at anything either  It hardly excites me
It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future , Oh   you mean palm reading 5  I've seen that before   but I don't believe in it
Ok   let's see   well   you've got a long life line   which is good   and the love line is strong , What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ?
You seem to have a large gullibility line  You believe everything that you're told , Hey !
Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost , You saw a ghost ? When ?
It was a big   green thing that looked like a person  It was in the kitchen   and it slowly moved towards the stairs , So what did you do ?
It moved slowly up the stairs   step by step   and I could hear its approaching footsteps  When it finally got to the top of the stairs   I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas  He had gone to get a late night snack , What's the matter   Lisa ? You don't look too good
That's what I thought  It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months , Two months ? How did you find out ?
Yeah   he first said it was someone from work  He gave me a lame excuse   and so I pressed him on it , What'd he do ?
I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her , Good  I totally agree with what you did
All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers , Oh   do you know why ? Actually   it ’ s easy  Because I always exercise  My exercise   I think   is very hard  I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties  I feel alive !
It ’ s true  Many students do the exercise when they have to  We have P  E  once a week , But I think Chinese students need to exercise more  Besides exercise will help them learn new things better  Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ?
Oh   I know  Thank you , Hey   what's new ?
What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? , Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter   your fortunes are falling  Bad luck will follow you today   and you will lose that which you value  Be careful
Ok   so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? , Well   we have the Thompsons   the Greens   and the Anderson   about twelve people total
Why can't we ? , It's an old superstition  If we have thirteen people at the table   then it means bad luck  Can Andy bring a date ?
I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill  It's only a superstition  It really doesn't mean anything , Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday !
I ’ m not a Christian  I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing , Believe what ?
What do you believe   John ? Are you Christian ? , To tell you the truth   I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not  Christians don ’ t often share the same belief  But I believe that we all possess   by the grace of God   the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth
Do you go to church regularly ? , When I ’ m home in the States   I go   but not in China
But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? , It should be   but there are too many options  My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices   but after that
I see  Well   don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school  He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right directionHe gave me some information   and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended , Thanks for the information  And good luck in your college search
That sounds like my Grandmother  She was always stubbornly independent , It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own
I saw an interesting program on TV last night  It was about elderly people , And what did the program say ?
And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress , And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise  My father is over 60 years old   and he lifts weights every day
That ’ s cool  Have you already found an apartment to live in ? , I ’ m planning on living with my parents  Won ’ t you ?
Not really   they just don ’ t want me living at home  My older sister did that   and she lived at home for seven years  Once she started living at home   it got harder and harder for her to move out , Well   it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life  They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with   but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so
Hey   Sandy   what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? , I wish I could   but I'm busy  I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight
How did you get involved in something like that ? , Well   the minister at my church told us about it   and it seemed interesting  I thought I'd try it once   and if I didn't like it I'd stop
Yeah   it sounds easy  How long does it take ? , Only about two hours   for a couple of days a month  Why don't you give it a try ?
So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? , Yes   in many ways it is  There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life
I do know you like rap music   but the other two are definitely false  I ’ Ve seen you play basketball , Hey ! But that's not the only problem  There's also the affirmative action stigma
Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all , Racist ? Not exactly  It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic   as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject  Suddenly I become the representative of the black race   as if we all had the same opinion
Yeah  Well it's quite some days since we were together last summerHow is everything going ? , Quite well  I got my MA degree two weeks ago
I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday , They spend hours there   especially on weekends
Isn ’ t that complicated ? , No   it ’ s easy  We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip  They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund
What do you do there  hang around   like the kids ? , Do you hear what happened to Sally ?
Why ? , She passed out in class  Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days
I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies  And all for a certain look , Well   it's not just the girl ’ s fault  It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying   It's in to be thin  It's hard for them not to listen
Huh ? Me ? , Yeah   you  I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground  Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering   so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there
Listen   I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue  It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space  It's not like there's garbage everywhere  Besides   someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another , It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people  It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people  If everyone thought like you   there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere !
Hi   Mr  Zhang  What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy  How was your date ? , I was turned down again  It ’ s frustrating  I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills
Believe it or not   I guess American women like a man in good shape   which Chinese women may not care about so much  That ’ s my honest opinion  I know you have been trying very hard , American men are naturally taller than Chinese men  So even if I exercise   there aren ’ t many chances
Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl   you could still have a stronger and healthier body  You won ’ t lose anything by doing that , Hi   my name ’ s Karl  My wife and I are moving in next door
This is a small town   and we like to be neighborly  We know everyone who lives around here , Well   I ’ m from Chicago  There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors
What do you do in your spare time ? , In summer I go hiking   and in winter I ski
Hey   Frank  I heard you got a new job , Yeah   Judy  I will be working for the Post Office  It ’ s not a bad job
So   why did you apply for such a demanding job ? , Well   the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits
That ’ s a great employment benefit ! , Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office !
Yes   Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn , Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful  I bet both of you are quite happy

Nope   sorry ! Actually   Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor ! , I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ?
You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose , In my book   all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up
It looks like you have to buy tickets for us   Jason  And we're not going to see an action movie ! , That's not fair   you got all the easy questions

I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone   so-called love at first sight , Anyway   I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that
I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet  I ’ m not knowing who is reading it , I'll tell you something that's good about action movies  The special effects are great !
James Cameron   of course , Well   did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ?
Don't feel like it  I'm broke , Well   we can still do some window shopping   can we ?
I never watch foreign films  They're too boring , Jason   you have no taste  You think First Blood is a good movie

Thanks   Hugh  I owe you one , I think you're being a little naive

You have a pager ? ! That's a little high-tech for you   Stu  Are you sure you know how to use it ? , Well   I know how to turn it off !
So why is the face tilted to the right ? , This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand

Be a little more open-minded   Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! , OK   but don't believe everything you see on The X-files   either !
It's a camera , You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ?
Well   there are adhesive strips on the backs  You can stick them anywhere , Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful   but he sure is powerful
Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids , Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are

I met a girl in elevator this morning  She works in a company upstairs  She said she envied the casual way we dress for work  She complained about the dress rule in her company  It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday , Well   I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from  Now   I know the answer
But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover  If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes   they can be less productive , Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ?
You are right  Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better  It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking , I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there

I guess the first thing is the price   the second is the size   and of course the color will play a role too  But I have to be honest  It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment  Therefore   I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car  You know   the rise in gasoline prices is huge  So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine  For which I can also save some tax  Last of the list   I also consider the safety , What about the environmental factors ?

And then ? , Then I talked to her and got her number  You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink
Open the door  It's me  I can't find the key , You're always so careless
So let's eat out , What do you want to eat ?

OK   OK  Enough already  We'd better hustle  The contest starts in five minutes , You've heard of Bruce Jenner   haven't you ?
I can think of better things to dream about , Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat   with his legs pumping away
Sorry   not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don   t what i should wear to fit thinner party , Just dress formal
Oh   i nearly forget it , You can put on your white shoes   it fits every occasion
I prefer summer   especially the summer evenings  When the sun comes down   it is so nice to take a walk and breathe  After a rain shower   the smell of the air is refreshing  It is also a best reason for ice-cream , How do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing   especially those clubs with live bands  The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad   full of smoke   and the music is too loud   so conversations are not really possible  Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette , How did that happen ?
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? , Sorry   I have to work overtime
Have you ever played Making ? , Not really   but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game
It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active , So   Monica   what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?
What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway   I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before  Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? , It is not an easy job  The government is working on it  Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital  Also   methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought  But of course   it will not work overnight  So   have you come out with a new plan for today ?
Well   I just came in  I worked overtime yesterday  Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate  So I stayed to double check them  The boss was aware of my very late work of last night  So before he left office   he told me I could come one hour later this morning , But you still look a little bit tired  What time did you leave ?
Working at weekend is something I hate to do most , But if the company asks   what else can we do ?
Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? , I will help to prepare food   feed animals and clean up  I ’ m very excited about it now
How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday   are you all ok ? , Can ’ t be better   it was wonderful  We had a lot of fun there  There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air  We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon
Well  You know I hate walking   but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video , Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great  They have safe tracks   especially for the beginners and provide free training  I think it suits you best
I will think about it , Come on ! It is really a fun game
Well   just something in general   like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals , Sounds practical ! To be honest   sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career  I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker  I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills
Look at this survey conducted by a website  A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things  Hi   Francis   what about you ? , Well   I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother  Anyway   I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave
But it is lucky for us  The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit  I have shopped too often online these days , Well   keep a low profile
You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college , Of course ! Everyday   there is a deadline to meet  Bosses watching and testing me all the time   not liking in college   handed in paper months later and tested on schedule  It is so busy  But anyway   I have trying my best to be a good employee
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? , How regular ?
But these people say nothing about that  They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days , That ’ s not right   somebody should do something
Yeah   and meet other drivers of the same car ! , Cool !
No  I borrowed it to go shopping , And lots of Dear Abby sob stories
Whatever  Smell ! Perfume samples ! , Nice  Hey   I like the layout of this page
Not yet  I'm not finished with my research yet , What research ?
Duh  That's the point  The people in the ads are wearing what's in  Plus   there are articles on new trends , How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ?
I want to try different things before I find the one I really like , Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ?
I'm pretty satisfied with it  I can broaden my experience   learn lots of new things   and have more development opportunities , Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age  It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier
When will we get one of those ? , You know our boss always trying to save the last penny  We have to use up the equipment first
It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture , You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler
I think I need a new notebook , Why ? Is there some new   cool computer out on the market ?
Believe it ! , It looks more like a toy   or a cool briefcase !
Well   mine are baggy  They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in , Mine are   too
Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear , Yeah  hearts   stars and some weird looking things
That's Madame Psychic to you , I'm waiting
I was born in Beijing   but I spent most of my childhood in London , What was your childhood like ?
My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing   but I decided to go back to England  I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication , What is your current occupation ?
Well   if you want to look professional   serious and more conservative   a blue dress   white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice  But sometimes   very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues  It depends on the company ’ s dress code , Indeed   I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview  Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony  It seems that their dress code is not that formal  Probably   I should put on car key and simple shirt
Well   to start with   Markweed Inc  has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field , The best  huh ? With so many companies out there   how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ?
From what I hear   they are very reasonable  A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives , Well   what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money
You bought a compact car ? , No   I borrowed it
I love it  It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo , I wonder what he looks like  Oh   I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hatoh   there he is
yes   I am the guy , what a bummer ! You set me up ?
Now what are you doing ? , Putting on mascara
And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face , I wish our competition will quit poaching our people   when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst   she was our fourth employee to leave us for them
Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies , With Susan leaving   we should probably look to someone new on board
Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? , Let me see  Laptop   flash disk   a ballpoint pen   a pencil   a notebook   a pair of glasses   cell phone   charger   moisture   notion    Oh   that is too much  You are not going to a business trip
I know  But it is my lucky charm  I carry it all the time , Suit yourself  Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock
It's not breathing ! , Yes   it is  Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on
Did you meet the new girl in our sales department  She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave , Did they finally fill that post   how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet
If the new girl is competent   maybe they will promote her when that time comes , Any plans tonight ?
Take it easy  It is all over now  How was it going   anyway ? , I don ’ t know  I think I did well in the paper exams  I was prepared to answer a lot of questions   but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected  To my surprise   the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me
Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? , Yes   not bad  Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers
I didn ’ t pay attention to that , I am totally fed up with my boss  He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments  This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment
Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad , You ’ re missing the point  It ’ s about respect  He treats us with such a patronizing attitude   as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers  It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed   not just his words
That is awesome  Congratulation ! I know you can make it , Thanks  Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening  Are you free ?
See you ! , I have made up my mind  I am getting a tattoo
Yeah but   it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment  On top of all that   I have heard it hurts a lot ! , Really ?
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos  Also   find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles   and that the place is hygienic , Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing !
What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? , You should consider the size and interests of your audience  In other words   who is listening   and what do they want to hear  you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention   but be careful not to go overboard
Hi   Francis , Oh   Mike  How are you doing ?
Oh   I haven ’ t noticed that before  Maybe I will try next time , Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you
Me too  Have a great day , If only our company prescribe flex time
Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting , Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season
Me too  Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? , I have confidence in them
Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish  So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch , No problem  What should I bring ?
That ’ s a matter of opinion , What do you mean ?
We have a fairly good working relationship   but there was also a rough spot , What do you think his strengths are ?
How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? , China provides the bulk of our product inventory   for sure  We import more than 40 different items from China  Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys  Japan produces many electronic exports   Germany produces excellent mechanical exports
I am really tired of Terry , Oh   but I suppose he has lots of talents
We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology   and it's surprising to see the results , What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ?
Well   these mediums are still important  they aren't a thing of the past  But I think they might be less important now than in the past  The technology age has arrived ! , Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think  After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year   I have really been able to make bank doing something I love
That's marketing research  But what about getting started once you have an idea ? , After you have your great idea   then you can set up shop by registering a domain name   creating a website   an email address   and a hosting service  If you want to go all out on your website   you can put together shopping cart technology   but that can be pricey to start out with
I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things  The government just talks   but in the long run   nothing is done to improve the economy , That's right  They always talk about a need for new   progressive tactics   but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs
I have a good solution  We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! , Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea  You can leave this job to Jason
But he is always talking big , Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press  Now every newspapers is all over it
What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? , I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences
I didn't think about that  That's pretty serious  Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? , I'm sure management is on top of it
The old page was okay   alright   but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume   because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect  Now it's different  We got our marketing department team in on the action   and the results are smashing , What changes were made from the old page to the new page ?
Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show  There are about forty or so that are hot  You should contact them immediately   in the next twenty-four hours if you can  The rest are categorized according to potential and interestYou can see we've got our hot stack   our warm stack   our lukewarm   and our cold but not dead stack , Haha  please don't tell me you've got a dead stack  I hate making cold calls
It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed  The trade deficit is getting larger   consumption's down   I really think we're headed for a recession , The economy has been stagnant for a while now  We've been in a recessive state for several months already  What worries me the most is the trade deficit  I think the government should do more to encourage exports
Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers   Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company   it would have some serious affects on our market strategy , Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company  They're supposed to be bitter enemies   the strictest of competitorsIt must be a rumorIt can't be true
I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competitionIf you can't beat'em   join'em , I heard a rumor this morning  It seems Trusten Tools is going out of businessAnother competitor is going bankruptThat could be good news for us
ProbablyThe new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweekOne of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company , Wow   with such a big changeWe won't have the same name ?
Five  Besides my parents and me   there are my brother and sister , That is a big family  How old is your sister ?
He ’ s not quite 25 , Do you miss your family ?
No  But I write to them often , How often do you write to them ?
Oh   not yet  At least have one for the road , No   thanks all the same
Well  Thank you for coming , So see you
Yeah  How's everything going ? , Not bad  At least I am still alive

Good morning   Miss White  You are half an hour early , I don't want to make a bad impression
One more thing   keep your desk neat  It's the rule  There is no exception   even the art designers have to keep their desks neat , I'll keep that in mind  Does everything on the desk belong to me ?
The operator will put all your calls through  You don't have to worry about that , Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ?
When you settle down   I'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers , Hi   Ann  I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ?
Yeah   definitely ! Thanks for inviting me , My pleasure
You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price , Not really  Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market  Besides   I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day
8 pm   that's fine with me , Okay
Ok   George  Bye ! , Bye   Ann !
And the streets are covered with ice  Do you know what the temperature is today ? , I missed today's weather for cast in the radio

Ask the worker who sells token to give you one  It ’ s free of charge  Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations , Do I have to pay additional fare to change train ?
Is that so ? I didn't know itCan I possible borrow a jacket and a tie ? , I'm sorry you can't borrow a jacket and a tie

Do you know Abraham Lincoln ? , Yes
He is known as American's greatest president  Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything  He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit , Well   if he can become president   then I can at least get a promotion
Good  How about you ? , I am going to resign  A few of the new staff have already left  Obviously   a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries
That's shortsighted  By the time the workers are experienced and contributing  They are likely to go , That's why I am going to leave
Well  The management doesn't seem to think that way  Anyways   you have to think twice before you act , Thank you  I will
What keeps you so busy ? You've been sitting there for hours  You've got to walk aroundYou just can't stay on the computer forever , Well   I am up to my neck in work  I've got to finish this report  Sarah needs it by noon  I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline

Really   John  I still think you should go to a doctor  You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning  Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor   at least you can go home and have a good rest , I can't  I am already behind the schedule  Besides   you know Mr  White  He would think that I was putting him on
Listen to me  You go home now  I will call my doctor and have him go over  Ok ? , What about MrWhite ?

You too  Oh   I forgot to tell you one thing  A girl called this afternoon  She said she was your ex-girlfriend  She wanted you to call her back , Did she mention anything else ?
Did you see May today ? , Yes   but why does she have such a long face ?
Yeah   especially since she got a promotion recently , I don't know  Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem

Hi   Jason ! Long time no see  How's the hotel ? , It's pretty nice   but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon  Hotel living is not for me
I am leaving in two weeks , So soon ! Well   I'd really like to see you again before you leave  Would you like to go out with me on Friday ? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards
7 is fine with me , Great  I'll pick you up at six thirty
My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office  I didn't know you were working hereWhat a surpriseHow long have you been doing this ? , Two years or so
Do you enjoy work here ? , It is hard to sayBut I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistantSometimes   I am really under great pressure when it gets busy
Glad to hear that , Hey   Jack ! Is Jenny coming with us ?
Just asking ? ! Why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh   someone has a crush on Jenny   doesn't he ? , Who has a crush ?
What are you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you are feeling about her , I ’ d totally die if she turned me down
Long time no see ! , Yes  It has been a long time since the last time we met
That's nice  Where have you been ? , I went to visit an uncle in San Francisco
How about a coffee in that cafe ? , Great  Let's talk over coffee
Well   I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common , So ?
Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? , That's a big question  Well   if you are in love   maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all
Yes , And maybe you suddenly have new interests  I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid   ieYou used to sleep in every morning   but because she jogs every morning   then you begin to like jogging
Thanks  But I know falling in love is one thing   while staying in love is another , Yeah   that's right  If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her   then you can stay in love
Hi   Mike  Haven't seen you for a while  How's Cathy ? , We are not seeing each other any more
Oh   I am sorry  Maybe you were just emotional at that moment  Do you think you guys can get back together ? , I don't know  There ’ s plenty of fish out there in the sea !
Nope  I guess something might have come up , I wonder what happened
Oh ? What happened ? , His sister had a car accident last week
Oh   poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year , How's your mother doing ?
Thank you , The world changes   the family changes too
That is called a nuclear family , I don't like such a family
It's a traditional family  It may be too large to live well , We can live well   I think
But don't forget to give me a ring , I won't   mom
Bye   my boy , What newspaper are you reading ?
It's too biased  I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting , New York Times is better ?
Well   it depends , Do you think the music is well-matched ?
It sounds nice , I like it  Naturally it can arouse your feelings
Full of energy and hope , Really  It's worth listening to and enjoying
Yes   reading is my hobby , What kind of books do you like to read most ?
Why ? , People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories
Oh   great ! , Which is your favorite in this ten ?
Yes  In fact   I think it's much better than this week's No  1 , What do you think about Cold Wind ?
Well  I don't like Your Lips very much , Why ?
Can we have two tickets for seven thirty ? , Yes   and would you like to have seats in the front or at the back ?
Thank you  And what's on tomorrow ? , Tarzan
What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? , I like it a lot  It has a very funny beginning   I think  It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it
What do you think of the ending ? , The ending is a bit weak  It's so abrupt   like those of most other detective stories
Really ? I don't agree  This Star Wars episode was incredible ! , Why do you think so ?
It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie , Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes
Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? , No   the casting is great and the actors were excellent  They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues  The writing was also a little weak
I've no idea  But looking at the success of Star Wars episode   I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon  I hope It will be even better than this one , I hope so   too
Here is the song list , Do you have any English songs ?
Let me play it for you , Is it easy to locate it ?
I'll sing a Chinese folk song Love song of Hanging   first in Chinese then in English , That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song
I don't know  If we can't   we can buy from ticket scalpers , No way  I'd rather go to another movie house
Seven thirty  There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line ! , Shall we take a chance ?
What can you expect with this crowd ? I am praying that no one will cut in the line , I don't think anyone will
The same to you   Joey , This is your first Christmas in the US  Here is the gift for you
As we know   mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives , It bears a great many of advantages   but also some weak points
That's true  Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones , Actually   it's not the fault of the mobile phone  But people should have a proper attitude towards it  Mobile phone is a tool serving people   not the fetters restricting them
What's the make of your camera ? , Olympus
Why ? , Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative  That's more   but that saves money
Oh   no  Carnations are not very elegantArtificial flowers have no passion , How much did you want to spend ?
I will take ten , Do you want to add some baby ’ s breath for that ? They are equally popular now
That's ok  Here is the address , Happy new year !
I've been invited over to a friend ’ s   and you ? , My roommate ’ s having a party
She told me she'd be here , They are announcing your flight  You'd better board the plane
I know what I am doing  Don't worry  Can you do me a favor ? , Name it and I'll do it for you
Thank you  Now I see that you are my true friend  Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt  You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time , I am just doing what I think I should do
Thank you  I have to leave now  If you see Pamela   tell her I'll write to her , The bridegroom looks a bit nervous
She is a beautiful bride , I am so happy for them
Harris and Anne are perfect for each other , Yes   they are
For the wedding ? , No   no   for the engagement
Yeah  Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues , But what are the sources of water pollution ?
Yeah  They are emitted directly into urban water supplies , But what about the indirect ones ?
Sure  It's an issue asking for everyone's participation , Look at these newlyweds  They seem as if they are on top of the world
Nothing seems to be happier for them , I can't bear you anymore  I am sick of your drinking  I am divorcing you
Have a heart   honey  You know I am trying hard to quit drinking   don't you ? Just give me one more chance   please ! , Are you a happy married man ?
I don't know  But they say that Mrs  Smith wears the pants in the house , You mean she bosses her husband around ?
That's true  Her husband is a fat cat , But I don't think she really loves him
But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough , The Blacks got divorced
Really ? I am surprised  He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife   does he ? , No   he doesn't  Anyway   his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time
I like that joke   but I hope it's true , Hi   Mike  We're having a party tonight   wanna come join us ? You can bring your girlfriend
No  She is really a very nice girl , Yeah   she is  She is pretty   caring   getting easy-going and she is a great cook  She is a gem
I've tried   but it didn't work , So   when are you going to tell her ?
I know , Hi   Is that David ?
Not much  My girlfriend just dumped me , Sorry to hear that  What happened ?
What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy  Oh   no   I feel like such a loser , Hey   she is not worth it  Forget her
Ok   then , But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face
Yeah   I know  You are right , Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ?
August bride  How nice ! By the way   who is going to be the matron of honor ? , Mrs  White
I think so  The wedding will be held at her church   right ? , Right  Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding
I heard you are going out with John ? , Yes  To be frank   I really love him to death
Why ? Are you kidding me ? A guy like that is hard to find  Few boys are so caring   so patient   and did I mention he is hottie ? , You really think so ?
Hey   Jenny  Would you like to go to dinner with me ? , I don't know  You know what they say about office romances
That's silly  What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business  Besides   it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here , You ’ Ve got a point  Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism  Then when the relationship went bad   he fired me
If it does   it will only make you more productive   because we can support each other , You are sounding like we are already married
I am talking about dinner tonight   not a lifetime , Most starts with dinner   but then it gets out of hand  Besides   haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ?
What can I say ? I am a passionate guy , Well   I hope you can find something else to be passionate about
Ok   I get the message  Hey   do you have any sisters ? , I'd like to meet you again sometime
Ok   got it  I will call you sometime next week , Fine
I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian , Thank you
Really ? That's the icing on the cake  Congratulation again ! , Thank you
Did you finish typing yesterday ? , Yes   I kept on typing it until midnight   but it is lost
How about the shelf ? , I've searched everywhere  Where on earth did I put it ?
Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week  There is no need to write a new one  Oh   what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? , Let me see  Yes   that's it  Where did you find it ?
You have a lovely house   Jack , Thank you  But a number of things have been going wrong lately
I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby  Could I make some suggestions ? , Go right ahead
You are welcome   Jack  Glad to be of help , Tom   did you see the film last night ?
Well   maybe so  But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion , Well   i don't see the point of arguing this
Please allow me to introduce myself  My name is Tom , Pleased to meet you  My name is Alice  Did you just move in next door ?
No   not really  When I left Vietnam   I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years  Where do you work   Alice ? , I teach mathematics at a college  What do you do ?
It's nice meeting you too   Alice , See you around !
Thank you  It's a pleasure to meet you , A pleasure meeting you as well   the flowers are for you
I know it's not good for me   but the problem is I just can't help it , Well   I've got an idea   put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes   and read it before you smoke  It may give you a feeling to reduce it
I've been feeling under the weather recently  I caught a bad cold last week   and I still haven't got over it , Well   you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good   long rest
Please do excuse me for a moment  I've got diarrhea , It's easy to get loose bowels in summer
I will  Thank you , Steve   you look pale  What happened ?
Well   I am under a lot of pressure  My boss is very pushy  He assigned me three projects  Now the deadlines are near   and I still have not finished all of my projects , Is there anything I can do to help you ?
I had to go get a cavity filled today , Did it hurt ?
It took quite a while   but the worst part was getting numbed  They had to give me 3 shoots , Well   I guess you've learned a good lesson   huh  You have to take good care of your teeth
I do   but it still does not cover everything , Man   they take a lot of our paycheck
Yeah   I don't mind it either  We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it   but what if we do   you know ? , Yeah  It won't be much   but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old
Really ? No   they couldn't  None of them would have jobs if they did , What did the doctor say ?
Yes   he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat , Yes   you must put yourself on a diet
That must have been wonderful  Do anything interesting ? , Well  We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia
Tell me about it , We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us
Hey   Mike  You've been surfing the Net for quite a while  What on earth are you searching for ? , It's something relative hackers  I often hear people talking about them   but I don't know much about them
You can say that , But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ?
There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers   but they aren't  They break into computers and break the phone system  Real hackers call these people crackers   and want nothing to do with them , So they are two totally different concepts
You got it , Thanks a lot
We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River , How hard is the climb ?
We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff  It's very exciting , Wow  That sounds like a lot of fun  I am sorry I missed it
Ok   see you , Hey   let's eat out tonight
Well   I am kind of broke , Come on  It's on me
Wonderful ! You know what ? I wish you wanted to relax everyday , Dream on !
Great ! I love swimming  Besides   I need a tan for Hill ’ s party , Don't forget the sun block lotion  You don't want a sunburn   do you ?
Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? , You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath   are you ?
Everybody who walks past me sees it  Besides   it's a good sunbathing suit , All right  Suit yourself  I am going swimming
Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand , I've got a better idea  Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ?
We went to the coast  It's really a nice place for camping   really good time around the fire singing and dancing , How many members were in your party in all ?
Yes   we got wet through  But we still enjoyed ourselves , What kind of books do you like ?
Which one do you like best ? , I prefer the novels by Hemingway   such as The Old Man and the Sea  I like the simple words in his novels
Oh   my ! It's really hot  I've never seen such scorching weather in my life , Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling
But it's already awfully close , Well   I just hope it'll level off
So how did you meet Bill ? , I met him through a computer bulletin board
I've heard about that   but I've never tried it , You ought to  One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time  A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network
I just want a private conversation with one other person , You can do that  A private session lets two people talk alone  This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody   without prejudice because you can ’ t see them
It ’ s that popular ? , It sure is
Well  You'd better take a hot shower right now   or you will catch a cold , I know  I don't want to get sick   especially during finals week
Yes   it is  The sun is shining  There is no wind   only a pleasant breeze , It is the best season for a picnic right now  Have you decided the place for your picnic ?
He ’ s predicting clear skies , Well   I will think it over
I hope it stays like this , I hope so too
What's the weather like in winter ? , It's pretty cold and it often snows
Neither too cold   nor too hot , That's quite a lovely weather
Once   when I was a child , Do they often happen in your country ?
How do you do ? , How do you do ? Nice to meet you   Ms  Smith  I ’ m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department  Here is my card
Thank you , Did you hear how cold it got last night ?
My car didn't want to start either at first , Don't you have a garage ?
I do  Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero , Does it ever get that cold on here ?
Lousy weather   isn't it ? , It has stopped snowing   but it's even colder
Do you know what the temperature is today ? , I missed today's weather forecast over the TV
That's great  Let's go skating together tomorrow , Her dress looks funny
Oh   come on   as long as it looks good on her , Well   you ’ re really as out-dated as she is
Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? , You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary  That's not the way a woman should stay attractive
Darned right I would ! , Maybe make-up would be enough ?
I don't care what other people think  I am ready for a lift , They are professors and government officials
What are they doing in Beijing ? , They are attending an international conference here
Look how fast that car can accelerate ! , I've never seen anything like it
Well I don ’ t think so  I don ’ t like it at all ! , I ’ m afraid you ’ re being too particular about your food
Poor us ! All this junk food lacks nutrition ! , Let ’ s dine out tonight for a change !
Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning , And later ?
How about you ? What are you going to do tomorrow ? , I have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the houseHow I envy you   Robin !
Lizzy smith , Of course I do
Yes , Sure  I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary
That sounds terrific , Why do you ask me these questions ?
What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job , Then   buy a bottle of soft drink
Ok   I will go there myself , Sorry   Mr  Polly
Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature , You do ?
Hi   how is it going ? , Pretty good   Sam  Only the awful weather   you know
You ’ re a wonderful person   Kathleen , So you are
Don ’ t   don ’ t   don ’ t   don ’ t say that  That   that makes it worse , What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me   either
But we ’ re so right for each other , I know   I know  Well   is there some   is there someone else ? Oh   that woman on television   Sydney Ann
Actually   I'm not good at tennis at all , Neither am I  It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club
How about the Classical Music Club ? , Joanna   give me a break
Have you ever made any plan for your future ? , Of course I have  I'd like to marry a handsome man and have two children if possible
Did you see Victor on Wednesday   Wendy ? , Yes  We went for a walk in the woods near the highway
It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods , Yes  Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere  We counted over twenty squirrels
Excuse me   you look familiar  Did you use to live in New York ? , Yes
Oh   did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student , Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ?
Yes   he ’ s a millionaire in Houston now , A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ?
What ’ s on TV tonight ? , Not much   that new reality-TV show   Ally McNeal   oooo   Dark Angel
No it ’ s not  It ’ s just funny , Yeah   if you ’ re a girl
It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits , O  K    O  K  Let ’ s forget it  There ’ s a football game on too
Thanks  I just got back from summer camp , How was it ?
I went sailing   fishing   and horseback riding , I ’ m so jealous
I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me   rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish , Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ?
Well   I suppose one of the problems is  will depend on what a person's life style is   and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television   he will then   you know   hmm  be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things , Do you think though that  that in    in a sense television skilled people's own er  sort of   creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ?
Hi Kate  thanks  wow ! Look at all the furniture  You must spent a fortune on it ! I love your new three-pieces suite , I told you that I had been saving up money to buy some new furniture and do some redecorating  I finally saved enough and did everything at once
To be honest   it looks like your old carpet  Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ? , Well spotted ! I actually had it cleaned twice   because it was so dirty  The rug is new  You remember my trip to china ? Well   I bought is there
How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ? , About a pack   more if I drink
He died of lung cancer   right ? , Yeah  you ’ re right  I really should stop smoking
And this bedroom is too big and damp  But it ’ s better than a tent , How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home
It sounds too bad  What will you do ? , Mike suggests me to return it
What ? , I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend
Hold on ! I can't afford to pay for both , Don't worry  I've got money  It's my treat
Why not ? , His father is a prisoner
Why   that's very kind of you   Mrs  Johnson  I'm sure my wife will be glad to , How about tomorrow afternoon ?
A few months , How do you think of living here ?
It's easy  All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory , But I heard it is very difficult to play
Total Fitness   why ? , Well   I ’ Ve been going to Athletic Express   but I don ’ t like it there
Oh   it ’ s one of those places , Yeah   is your club different ?
Yeah   they have all the machines   a pool   and a steam room and sauna , Sounds nice  What about classes ?
Well   I have a guest pass  Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ? , Really ? Thanks  I ’ ll stop by when I get off work
Hey John   nice skates  Are they new ? , Yeah   I just got them  I started playing ice hockey in a community league  So   I finally got myself new skates
Yeah   you ’ re a pretty big guy  I play goalie   myself , Oh   yeah ? Which team ?
All right   see you later , Believe it or not   one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide
I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes , Have you seen Harry ?
Maybe you'll call his home , Are you coming or not ?
Ok   count me in , How are your parents these days ?
Sure   thank you , How is your business going ?
Welcome  I could use the help , Would you mind if I use your tape-recorder ?
OK  You can keep it as long as you need , So how long have you known Mary ?
I know  I can't help thinking about her  She's always on my mind , What musical instrument do you play ?
No   no  My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public , I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding
I couldn't have asked for more , Who do you think will win the championship ?
That sounds great ! , Why you are so crazy about Beijing Opera ? It's so boring
Come on  I don't see any point in arguing about this  Everyone has a right to his own opinion , Hi   Mary  You look pale today  What's the matter with you ?
Thank you  I suppose I should go to see a doctor , Would you like to drink some coffee ?
All right , Has your family lived here for long ?
Yes  I love living here , Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley
Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician , I ’ m so thirsty
I ’ ll buy you a drink , Oh ! Thank you
I know   but I'm really hot , I'd strongly recommend that you wait for a while before going swimming
Here's to you   Mary ! , Cheers !
I bought it on a street market  A real bargain ! , I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing   because it is not only nice but lasts a long time
After five days ' hard work   I'm surely going to have some fun , But I'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest
Really ? , You bet  You should try it yourself
Same here , I was looking forward to your arrival
Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great , Yes   me too  But I'm disappointed
I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here , I think you're right  Let's go
That's a great idea  Let's go to a Chinese restaurant , I know one  Let's go
I don't blame you for getting some rest , Yeah  I need to
Can you recall the games ? , Sometimes  But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup  It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen
Oh ? Why is that day ? , It is said that the Cowherd and the Spinster   the lover stars in heaven   can only meet on the seventh Eve   so this day has become the Lover's Day
Why is that ? It is called real art , Well   it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language  That kind of gets on my nerves
I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself , And I came up and asked to sit by you
But   I want to ride it   Daddy , Ok   I guess it's worthy of two yuan
No   I think Harry will get it , Let's make a bet on who gets it
Just between you and me   I think he's lazy , Haven't you ever seen him working late ?
Yes  I do one set of shadow-boxing every morning after I get up , Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ?
Yes  I'm leaving tomorrow  I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you , You're so thoughtful  Wish you a good trip home  And we'll miss you
Yes  I've got to cancel my traveling plan , What a pity ! I know you've been longing for it these months
Have you ever been to it before ? , Yes   lots of time  I was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have
I heard about that  It was successful , It's a big jump in science  Maybe more like a leap
What's the problem ? , Should I date Tom or should I date Harry ?
Sometimes   if there's music playing , What kind of dancing do you like ?
Yes  I'm afraid so , But you'll miss out on the football game
No   not yet  I'm really worried , Well   it'd be foolish to call the police  He probably just went away overnight
Okay  Loser has to take out the trash for a month , It's a deal
Keep it  I'm buying tonight , No   you can't do that
It's ages since I went to see a film , Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student
Of course not , I ’ m Jack  What ’ s your name ?
I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice  And my father doesn ’ t like it  But my mother likes it very much  So we often come here , How often ?
It ’ s my mother  She ’ s fond of swimming  And the man beside her is my father , Do you like swimming ?
I like it  But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you , I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town  You can still fill me in on tile details

They might actually win the game , So   what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new   isn ’ t it ?
Yes  You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients , Did you buy new cupboards too ?

I'm not too scared  But I've done sky diving before , Do you like ice skating ?
Sorry   I don't think I can , Friday then  How about it ?
I just saw Something About Mary last night  It was hilarious , David took me to it last week  I thought it was a little sick
Why not ? , I just think the humor was too gross  There were too many disgusting things in it  I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny
Oh   you are too conservative  It's just realistic , I don't think it's realistic  I thought it was sick  Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor ?
Well   let's get together soon , Okay  Would you like to have lunch some day next week ?
Well unfortunately   I'm tied up on Tuesday  I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town   and I don't think there's any way I can get out of itAre you free on Wednesday ? , Wednesday ?

Well   what a nice day ! , Yeah   the air is really fresh
Did it ? , It sure did  It was a heavy storm   with lots of thunder

Why is that ? , We've been planting trees for many years
Then what about spring ? , Spring is warm and short in Beijing
Thanks for reminding me , You're welcome
It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing , Are you Chinese by birth ?
I like it so far  But my English still needs work , I want to study Mandarin and public relations
You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo  Talk about robbing the cradle ! , Well   you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan
Hey   Karen  Look like you got some sun this weekend , Yeah ? I guess so  I spent the weekend at beach
So   what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun   obviously , I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball  You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand  I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down
It all sounds so relaxing  I wish I could get away to the beach like that , It looks like you could use it  Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again

I don ’ t actually know him , Really ?
Yes , Hmm  You ’ Ve got mail

Yes   I've just come from the States   yesterday in fact  I'm still a bit confused about the time , Welcome to Beijing  This is my business card  I'm an engineer  If you need any help in Beijing   just give me a call
What's the date today ? , It's October the 1st   our National Day  I'd like to talk some more   but I've got to get going now  It was nice talking to you   though
That's my grand-father  He was a farmer  When he was young   he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field , Oh yes   that was the best job in most farm families  That's where many of them learned to play the flute
My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business  He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school , So he became a self-taught man ?
As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country , Is he still in that that type of work
Well   maybe when I get old  But first I'll be a lawyer , He has lots of hobbies
But as for his business in the city , He lets his cousins look after his business

I hope so   too , Hello   Lily
What would you like today ? , I ’ ll have the leg of lamb
Oh   yes   it is  Thank you  I was looking for it just now , You look a bit familiar to me  I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before
Just two blocks away   in that tall building , That ’ s it  I live there   too  I live on the sixth floor
I ’ m Chen Ming , How do you do   Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei
No   I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing , Are the children all grown up now   Rose ?
She ’ s a librarian at the public library , Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl
Larry drives a truck  He drives all over the country  We hardly ever seen him , Really ? Where does he live now ?
Oh   no  Rocky is a pilot , Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ?
Mm ? , Can my friend   Tom Mitchum   come home with me for lunch tomorrow ?
Oh   yes  I remember Tom  His family comes from Maine   right ? , Yes
Luckily that was nothing serious , Thank God !
How do you know ? You haven ’ t seen her since high school  I guess your evenings   whatever you do with them   are just too valuable , That has nothing to do with it
Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson ’ s over for dinner on Thursday , And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof
You ’ re right  I wasn ’ t  I hear nothing , Nothing ?
Engaged ? , Come on
How many passengers are there aboard the ship ? , Seventy-six   I think
Well   tell me  How was the labor and delivery ? , I wouldn ’ t say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch
Neither can I , I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill  I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing
Relax  I can hold my own  Now   point your skis toward the bottom of the hill  Easy does it ! , I don ’ t think I can get up enough nerve to do this
There  Now   wasn ’ t that fun ? As soon as you get a second burst of energy   we ’ ll , Don ’ t hold your breath !
This paper absorbs water so quickly ! , Yes   it's great for cleaning up spills
Out ? What do you mean out ? , You know on a date   they are going to dinner
You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? , That ’ s right   once a week  Do you want to order some pizza ?
I see  Then what about tomorrow   at Starbucks ? , I ’ m afraid not   George  You gotta know something   I ’ m not available any more  but I know Becky has a crush on ya
I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday  But thank you just the same , That ’ s a pity  We can arrange another time hopefully
Sure  We ’ ll be looking forward to that day , So will I  Thank you
I know   but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing , See your problem ? You get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down
Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again   you gotta be nuts  Last time I ate that food   almost vomited  The service in there is terrible  It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter , Yeah   not seeing a single person anywhere informed me  Hey ! How about that one over there ?
In that case   I ’ m right behind you , Like to come over to our fancy dress party ?
Yeah  Thanks  And have fun ! , Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ?
Well   nothing really serious , Well   you know what   don ’ t do it   ‘ cause the minute you do   they lose all respect for you
Confusing  But not   because it ’ s nothing , Where ’ d you meet him ?
Oh   books   and music   how much we both love New York  Harmless   harmless   meaningless  Bouquets of sharpened pencils  Oh , Excuse me ?
Who ’ s that boy ? , Where ?
I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building , How do you do ? I ’ m Parker
Oh   Parker with a P ? , Yes   with a P
Yes   with a B , Won ’ t you come in   Mr  Barker ?
Do you really ? , What do you mean ?
Yes   she is , Does she teach Chinese ?
You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother , What ’ s the matter   Sally ? You look so unhappy
I went to the library and lost my bag , Your bag ? Did you get it back ?
What ’ s the date today ? , December the fifteenth  The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday
How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now , And don ’ t forget Mary   Tom ’ s twin sister  It ’ s her birthday   too
I'll try to speak more clearly , How did you two meet ?
Hi   Jim , Where is that cool guy   Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks
Yes   Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP , I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss
That sounds great ! , If the weatherman's predictions are accurate   it should rain tomorrow
Is your waist any better ? , Yes   I ’ m feeling very well these days
Then when will you be back again ? , I will be back again next Wednesday
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? , Don't bother  those are a dime a dozen where we are going
I will give you premium unleaded  Alright ? , Sure   why not ?
It is the most expensive , Well   I don't want it then  Can I move to another pump ?
I'm sorry   sir  This is not a full service gas station  I will help you fill the gas   but we don't wash windows here , Really ? Well   I guess I have to get used to it
Hello baseball fans   and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course   I am here   once again   with the man that seals the deal   Bob Copeland , It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions
A very nice curve ball by the pitcher  The catcher gives him the sign   he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! , The players are scrambling to get the ball  Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe !
Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! , Hey   Ted  What are you up to this Friday ?
Well   I ’ Ve been working so hard lately   so I ’ ll probably just take it easy , Sounds nice
Sure  Any time , We have to pick up Conrad before the party
Wait a minute  Cal's bar ? , Yes
I thought he was maybe gay   but I wasn't sureAnyhow   you don't expect me to go into a gay bar   do you ? , Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there
Yeah   but who wants to go in ? I'm not gay   you know  Why should I go in a gay bar ? , You sound like you're afraid
No   never , But it's just a bar  There's no dangerYou shouldn't be so homophobic
No   I don't  But I never went into a gay bar before , Don't worry about it  There is nothing strange about itIf Conrad's there   we'll leave for the partyIf he's not   we'll sit down and have a drink
Fine , You're late
Yes  An automatic message says your phone is not in service , Really ? I had no idea  Let me checkYes   it's dead  There's no dial tone
About what ? , You know whatThe theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my playThey are supposed to call me this eveningIf I don't have a phone  Oh   what can I do ?
No  I hate cell phonesBut you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone , Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house  It isn't far  I can call the theater guild from there and give them her numberShe will let us wait in her living room
Alright   let's go , Yes   let's go
What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? , Well   to begin with   Gambling is addictive   ruins marriages   destroys families and bankrupts communities  Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop  People have lost their houses   cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted  Secondly   it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk  Women gamble to escape   and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction  Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies
Bill  Bill ! You gotta help me ! , What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack
That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people , That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry  On top of that   I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her  At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like !
Now that ’ s a great idea ! , Honey   do you have a second ?
Okay , I ’ Ve been thinking   and well   I think we need to start seeing other people
So   what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? , Tim   you are too good for me  You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy  Oh   I could say that I ’ ll be all you need   but that would be a lie  I know I ’ d only hurt you   I know I ’ d only make you cry
Laura , Here are your keys  I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week  I ’ m sorry   Tim  I wish you all the best   and I hope that one day we can meet again  I ’ ll always love you  Goodbye
What was that ? , Nothing ! Anyway   you ’ re right   there ’ s no reason this has to be nastyMy lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property   as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog  So that ’ s done  finally
I believe that was a wedding present to both of us   Joanne  And you hardly ever use it ! , He ’ s my grandfather   and he never really liked you anyway !
Which ones ? Let me have a lookWow   look at that ! That brings back memories  That ? , Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day  We were going to visit the Trev fountain   and we got caught in the rain
Oh   Joanne   are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you , Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle
I'm glad you liked it  Are you ready for dessert ? , I don't know  I'm pretty full  What are we having ?
Great  Would you like coffee or tea with that ? , I'll have a cup of tea
Definitely  Would you like skim or whole milk ? , Skim   please  That'd be very nice  Thanks  oh no  Janna   I'm so sorry   but I've got to go
I'll go with you  Where is she ? , She's on the M40   near Reading
Don't worry  Family comes first  Come on   let's go , Actually   I've only got a two-seater  I'll have to go on my own
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? , Yes   are you ?
It wasn't cold out this morning , Well   it's started raining since then  Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there !
It does   actually  Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping , That's a good idea  But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it
I don't know  The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night , Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse
If I'm not back in ten minutes   come and find me , Alright  I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you
What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? , It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain
Well   I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends , You might want to change your plans  With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow   the roads are going to be rather slippery
If you're lucky   it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! , If that happens   then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies
English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought , Hi   charlie   are you busy this evening ?
I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday , How old is he today ?
Sure thing  What are your plans for the evening ? , I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight
Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us , Sounds that way  Maybe some other time then ?
Say hello to your friends for me , Likewise  See you later
It's Beethoven  Do you like it ? , I think Beethoven's music is incredible  I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent   too  Do you believe that ?
Actually   I mostly just listen classical music  What about you ? , To be honest   I think classical music is too complicated for me
Not really  I don't think pop music has much depth , I see what you mean  I think that's way I like it so much
Not really  When I was little   we didn't really listen to music at all , So   how did you become interested in it ?
Yes   it's one of my hobbies , Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing  It ’ s supposed to be really good
I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts   so it might be interesting  I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed , What did the critic say ?
Good  Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go  The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results , I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won  There were a few surprises
I like those kinds of programmes too  They ’ re very informative  I think that many people underrate the education value of tv , I agree  People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence
in my country   there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown  I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour , that ’ s great idea  But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ?
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country   but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes  Besides   the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes , well   there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes  Shall we ?
Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director , I have had disagreement with every director  I ’ Ve worked with  We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences  It was the same when I made this movie  I don ’ t no
Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? , I wanted to   but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me  All of my stunts were done by a stuntman  As you know   I used to do my own stunts   but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future
Yes  I have  I liked it very much  Like you   I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie  She ’ s going to be a star , what did you do over the weekend ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves   but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening , like what ?
if you do have to drive   you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol  Also   your home should use sources of renewable energy , how about recycling ? Does that actually help ?
I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone , I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !
Yes   I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once  The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over , Do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ?
Where are you from ? , I'm from the plains of the Midwest  It's a prime location for tornadoes
Wow   that must have really been scary , Actually   some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass
That sure didn't last long ! , how are you doing ?
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving , was it his first offence ?
not much ; it was a minor offence back then  He got away with a fine of $ 500 , did they take his license away ?
well   he'll definitely lose his license   pay a fine   and maybe even spend some time in jail , that doesn't sound too promising  Does he have a defence lawyer ?
that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help , Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?
I have a good idea to solve it  The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes , It would probably be very expensive
If we are to invest more money to education   we will need to raise taxes  That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters , Most voters what everything both ways  They want the government to pay for lots of things   but without increasing taxes
Good morning  I ’ m from the new york book review  Could I ask you some question about your latest book ? , Sure  Take a seat  what would you like to know ?
How do you research your books ? , I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories  Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met  Most charact
Oh ! Thank you very much  I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories  What are the stories about ? , There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book  I haven ’ t finished all of them yet   though  Many of them are short detective stories   but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones  If you give me your
Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention  There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years , I love being photographed ! If I were famous   I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines   like cosmo and elle
I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns  You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said  If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly   it , I think you ’ re right about that  I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson  I could do a lot of charity work   which would help a lot of people
You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity   so you ’ d really need to be very careful  Anyway   I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book - , Thanks   but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography
How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? , Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays   especially the ones where he only played a bit part
Are you a member of his fan club ? , I was   but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet   so I ’ m not a member now
Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of   right ? , I think that show biz stars have a really easy life  They have lots of money   so they can buy almost anything they want  They ’ re famous   so everyone loves them
I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves  They only want it for their films , No way ! They want publicity for themselves   so that they get invited to make more films   go to lots of cocktail parties   and even make albums ! They have such an easy life  They don ’ t even pay for Drin
I think you should give them some credit  They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn  They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves , Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves
Well   you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader   right ? , Yes
She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back , Wow ! That's really great news  How often does the magazine come out ?
Yes   but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! , Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?
Me   too  Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? , Sure   where would you like to go ?
Yes   I ‘ d love to  it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good , I like watching it for the fashion  I like to see what the ladies are wearing  Of course   the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo
You ’ re right  This year should be much more exciting than usual  What ’ s you favourite award category ? , You might think this strange   but I like the category for best foreign language film
Yes   I am  I enjoyed studying it at school   though I had trouble remembering all the dates   so my teacher never gave me good marks , I love history   but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened
What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice   do they ? , The idea is that the people and dates change   but the reason why things happen stay the same
I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey   where many historic figures are buried   like Isaac Newton   the great mathematician and Winston Churchill   the great wartime leader , Nearby   on the banks of the thames   there ’ s the statue of Boadicea  She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain
There ’ s a lot to see there  Perhaps we should go tomorrow , I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison  Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past  I really want to see the crown jewels too
There you can see british leaders   entertainers   criminals   and royalty , Sometimes   it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !
I love going to art galleries   particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art , I never understand the meaning of those painting  They are too abstract for me  I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school
I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards  Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there , That sounds fine  What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?
Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent  What did you think of it ? , I liked it  I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces   but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring   in my opinion
Yes   I do  I like painters who use rather than watercolors  The colors appear richer  What do you think ? , I agree  I prefer oils too  I collect landscapes   but I only have a small collection  You have a small collection of abstract art   don ’ t you ?
I know what the characters on the paintings mean  I think Chinese characters look very artistic  It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character , I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts
Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? , I guess so  I usually buy name-brand clothing   shoes   and electronic goods  How about you ?
I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time   but I don't think it always makes sense , Do you have a brand preference for anything ?
It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it , I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention !
Not really  I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie  Do you want to go with me ? , Sure  What movies were you thinking about going to ?
That's the one  It's an actioncomedy  What do you think ? , To be honest   I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead  Besides   I like movies with a happy ending best
Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? , Yeah   I suppose you wouldn't want to see that   huh ?
Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen , That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ?
Sounds good  I'll see you then ! , So   have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ?
Yeah  Even though the customs were brilliant   I didn't think it was as good as the first two  What did you think ? , I thought the special effects were amazing   but I got a bit confused  The plot was too complicated for me
Yes   I've read them many times  I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters , Yes   trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me
That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries , I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars
Sure   thanks  I brought you a bottle of wine as well , You're the first guest to arrive  I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink
This is a very nice place  How long have you been living here now ? , Just over three weeks  Would you like a drink ?
I'll have a glass of red wine please , One glass of red wine coming up !
Oh   I thought there were going to be eight  who isn't coming ? , Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment  Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well
Which language do you speak ? , Well   I studied French at school   but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it  I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes  Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa
It ’ s not easy   particularly with listening and speaking   because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good , I bet you find the character difficult to write !
Yes  How are the Spanish classes going ? , In a way   it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese  Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones  But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself
No   no   a friend of mine taught me this really fun game  I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face   and you guess who it is ! , OK !
Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK   my turn  He has a crooked nose and full lips  He has quite a few freckles and an oval face  Oh   he is also bald ! , Your future husband !
I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend   Mary  There is a storm system moving through the East Coast  It will be drizzling all day today   and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve , That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ?
It gets better on Sunday   though  The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night  It will still be rather cool   with highs in the low 50s  The West Coast will be experiencing some , Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ?
Yeah   good ideaWe can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill  I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot , Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers
Not much   just heading over to the shooting range  You wanna come ? , Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man
Whoa   take it easy there Rambo  Don ’ t get carried away  These weapons are not toys   and you must first learn how to handle them properly  There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be , Wow   I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
Oh   man  I had the best supper last night  My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! , I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce  Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts  Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime  I would die for a plate of stir fry right now !
Those are the headlines for today   and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson , Thank you   Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many   a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world  In Switzerland   a major avalanche was reported in the Alps  Fortunately   no one was injured  Due to to the extreme cold this winter   a blizzard has struck the US Midwest   causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled  Moving to to Latin American   Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming   but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country  In Chile   a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region  Losses are reported to be in the billions  Authorities have not yet released an official statement
I ’ m hungry   let ’ s grab a bite to eat , Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ?
What are you talking about ? I have salads some times , Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well  You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy !
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? , What ? Why do we have to do that ?
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time  Here in California   we are in Pacific Standard Time   that is eight time zones west of Greenwich  Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well   then we were in China Standard Time   and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! , That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference   even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours   we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time !
What are you talking about ? Let me see that  What are horoscopes ? , It ’ s a prediction of your month   based on your zodiac sign  You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in  I was born on April 15th   so I ’ m an Aries  When were you born ?
That ’ s bogus  I don't feel any stress at work   and my love life is practically nonexistent  This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense , No   it ’ s not   your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality  See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize
What are you doing ? , What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ?
What ? , The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs  South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players  I think that South Africa
Sounds interesting   but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me , Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team   hoping they will bec
Now that it ’ s the new year   I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf , Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
Well   first of all   I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking  It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything   it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen   and I think it ’ s time to stop , I ’ m with you on that one  Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ?
Hey  Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! , I am not cheating  When you pass go   you collect $ 200   Everyone knows that !
Yes , Can I have my $ 200 please ?
Yes   it's beautiful weather we're having , We can't complain about the weather recently
I hope it will stay fine tomorrow  I'm going to have a picnic with my family , What's the weather forecast for today ?
No   but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow , I wouldn't either  It's been looking like rain for several days
Very well   thanks  Nice to see you again  I haven't seen you for a long time  What have you been doing lately ? , Oh   nothing much really  And how is everything with you ?
I've been studying for my exams  My school exams will begin next month , Really ? Good luck for them
Where are you going now ? , I'm going to do some shoppingWhy don't you come with me ?
Good-bye  See you again sometime , Oh   George   what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A
Ok kids   here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee   a pail and a shovel  I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave  Don ’ t stray too far  Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes , And stay in the shallow area  I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier
Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! , Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started !
This next one is from Betty , A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty   thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
OK   that ’ s all of themNo more gifts  Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? , Umm  I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
I'm catching the eleven o'clock train , Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch
I'm glad to help you  What's wrong ? , My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in LAHank and I will be flying there tonight
You need a babysitter , Yes   I'd ask Jill   the girl I've had before   but I need someone overnightMaybe even for two nights
Why not ? , Your own kids would get Suzy's cold  I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here  But I don't know who to ask  I need someone more mature than Jill  It might even be for two or three days
I'll get you her number  I hope she can do it  She is very responsible , I'm glad you know someone  I knew you would be the best person to ask about this  I don't want to insult Jill or her mother  I think Jill maybe could do itBut I'd rather have someone a little older
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch  I'm stuck ! , I'm worried   Tom  I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour
I wanted to show you the cabin  We only had another half-hour to go , Well   now we're stuck  What can we do ?
What do you mean ? , We're stranded here   Tom  We may be here a long timeWe need to conserve the gas in the car  The car's energy is what will keep us warm
So what can we do ? , Turn the lights offThen   run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hourThat will conserve the heat as long as possible
Days ? , Yes   it happensThat is what happens in big snowstorms  People get stranded for days
Okay   I'll follow your advice , Hi  What's up ?
Me too  Seems like all I do is eat and sleep , Gotta go  Call me tonight
Thank you   Rick ! As you can see   ladies and gentleman   we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! , Whoa   that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing
Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today  On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par  He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot , It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees  He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it
What is a tornado warning ? , It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area
I understand  They think a tornado might come , Yes  People should look out   because maybe there will be tornadoes comingSo it's called a " watch  "
It's scary , Well  Tornadoes can be dangerous   it's trueIf we hear something like a loud train coming   then we have to go in the basement
But if you hear them coming   isn't it already too late ? , Maybe  It depends on the tornadoSome can move across the ground at 200 miles an hourThat is very fast  Others aren't so fast
Did it hit their house ? , No   it didn't  But they are glad I called them
That's terrible  Do many people die in tornadoes ? , Not so many really  But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes
Aw   come on   it was nothing  I'm just doing my job , No   I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean   if I look back on your previous presentations   this is a huge improvement
Yeah   well   that was some good advice  You made some really good points , Well   I just wanted to say well done  Really you did a great job
That ’ s it   my lease is up  I have to move , What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ?
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something  You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here  I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while , Well   let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out
Hey there   you look a little lost  Are you new here ? , Yeah how ’ d you know ?
It ’ s ok   I know how it is  This machine here will work out your upper body   mainly your triceps and biceps  Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? , Well   I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio
It ’ s not that much  Just watch  I ’ m ok , I ’ m forming a music band
Aside from yourself   who are the other members of the band ? , We have a guy who plays guitar   and another who plays bassAlthough we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer  You told me that you had some musical talent   right ?
Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers   microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? , This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ?
Well   sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently , For example ?
You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! , Well   I have no regrets !
I ’ Ve been playing computer games , What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ?
My laptop is on my bed  If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me , Fine !
You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! , Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple !
Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games   get him some gag gifts and just have a good time  Nothing too over the top , Well   I don ’ t know
What ! , Okay   next question  If Eric asked you out on a date   what would you say ?
If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! , My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that !
You should have seen the T  V  show that was on last night   the topic it covered was really interesting   animal rights , Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something   they should do it on civil rights
You can ’ t compare apples and oranges  I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them   the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance  I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching , Well   you are right on that point  This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products
What is that ? , A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play !
What about all these other pieces ? , See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook  The one with the tall hat is called the bishop  See this little horsey ? This is called the knight   it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it
Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! , Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ?
I wanted to   but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place , Right on   right on ! Well   Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread   but Sherry paid for everything
Can we talk ? , Sure   honey   we ’ re talking now   aren ’ t we ?
I want to know where this relationship is going  I ’ m in love with you and I need to know , You know   I think you ’ re awesome
Look   if you don ’ t love me   it ’ s not a thing   alright   we ’ Ve had our laughs   but I don ’ t appreciate  maybe it ’ s just time we , Baby   I love you so much
Oh   I love you too ! , Come on  Put the gun down
Thank you Dick  Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King  Tell me Dave   what is your impression of this film ? , Well   I think this film is simply a fable   depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power   and in my opinion   it ’ s a very fine film  Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countriesThe musical score was amazing   the animation was very well done   and the story was simply enchanting
Well   that ’ s just it  It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies   or the dark   grim portrayal of Scar  Even so   the film is linear  Mufasal dies   Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault  Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his  It ’ s just too cliche , How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption   and teaches children the value of respect   life and love
Anyway  That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot   How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot   I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! , Where to   miss ?
From China , Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me   if you don ’ t mind me saying so
Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? , Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !
Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? , Uh  yeah  of course !
What ’ s the weather looking like today   Kenny ? , Well   it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today  we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah   and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day   with a day-time high of forty-five degreesNow   if we move down to the south of the state   we can see that a cold front is moving inWe can expect clear skies   but it will be quite cold   with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark
You heard it folks ! It ’ s gonna be a cold one ! , That ’ s right Bill  We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news  That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning
The ref signals the start of the game and here we go  Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball  Chen bumps it to the setter   and  a very nice set by Chen ! , Xu spikes it ! Wow   what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in !
Hey   you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? , Well  I told them not to come  I made a reservation just for the two of us  I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves
Sure  What is it ? , Hmm  okay   here ’ s the thing  I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend   and I can ’ t take it any more  I know you better than anyone   I know the pros and cons of your personality   I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together   don ’ t you ?
I  I , Excuse me  Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ?
Welcome  My name is Johnson , Nice to meet you
Well   first it is important to go through a good stretchYou must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines , Yes   I know thatDerek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics roomSo I'm ready   I think  I can start using the machines
No  Not that  I mean a training cardThe card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machineHere   let me show you , I'm ready
Yes  And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machineToday   I will go through the machines with you one by one  I will show you how to use themAnd we will determine what is a good starting weight for you , Alright  Great
Are you alright ? Can you do more ? , I'm sorry  I know there are still seven machines  But I'm exhausted
We can just go through them next time  It's no problem  ReallyThe most important thing is to know your limitsSo if you feel burned out now   it is good to stopBecause if you strain a muscle or hurt your back   then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks  Right ? , Yes  I suppose it's best to stop
I know   but it's 12 , 12
I never stay out that late  That's too late , But why is it too late ? It's Saturday nightYou have nothing to do tomorrow  Why not stay out and drink with us ?
What is that they're doing on the couch ? , They're smoking pot  Don't worry about it
But   Sharon   that's illegal ! The police could come   and we could go to jail , Don't worry about it  It is true that pot is illegal in AmericaBut the laws aren't as strict as in TaiwanIf people are arrested   and they have a little pot in their possession   they don't go to jail  They just have to pay a fine
I didn't know you had such wild friends  Do you smoke marijuana too ? , I tried it a couple times  But I don't like it  I like alcohol betterDon ' t worry about them   though  If you don't want to smoke pot   you don't have to
I don't know if I can drink more  I already had two drinks , You had two drinks at nine o'clock  C'mon   Ann   you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink
Alright  I'll have another drink , I'm going over to the gym  I want to do some running
Yeah   I suppose  I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather , No   it's not  Not at all  I'd probably freeze my lungs
Yes   why not ? Just let me get my gym clothes together , I didn't know you could exercise
No   not at all  I was on the swimming team in high schoolAnd I'd like to do some weight training  They have decent equipment at that gym , You're going to lift weights ? Hah !
Maybe not  But I want to start  I need to get in shape  I feel these past couple months that my energy is low , It's true  If a person doesn't exercise   they get sluggishThat ' s why I keep running  Even in the winter
I know  But I want to start today with a little weight liftingThen I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles   and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool  How does that sound ? , It sounds like a good plan to me  I'm still  I mean
I am kind of nervous , Nervous ? Why ?
Maybe  I know I agreed to go with you   but now I don't feel right about it , Listen   RyanCatholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the churchYou don't have to pretend to be Catholic  It's okay if you just come to listen
Alright  But will we sing ? , Yes   but you don't even have to sing  If you want to sing along   you can
And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? , No  That is something only true Catholics doSo if you come to the church as a visitor   you only listen to the serviceBut you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wineOnly after someone joins the church   then they go up for the Eucharist
It doesn't sound like an English word , It's not  It's an ancient Greek word  It means gratitude
Karen   do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something , Sure  What is it ?
I am worried about the meeting this morning , Why ? I think the meeting went well
I'm afraid I was too rude , Rude ? You weren't rude at all   Annie  Why do you think you were rude ?
Really ? , Yes
Yes  And he is the president of the company , Listen   Annie  You shouldn't worry about Mr  DrummondHe is a very good man to work for  He is not sexist at allHe appreciates people for their ideasAnd he is willing to take suggestions from men or women
Good  Thank you for telling me this , Any time  If you have a good idea   don't be afraid to speak upThis is a company that appreciates initiative
Do you mind if I put my jacket there ? , No  It's no problemAre you American ?
Well   there are many Chinese Americans   you knowAnd your English is very good  You sound like an American , I don't think so  You are flattering me
Well   yes  Actually   I'm going back to visit , You were visiting Taiwan ?
Yes  Why not ? , May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ?
I have lived in Taichung for two years nowSo this is the second time I am going back to states  I go back once a year to visit my family , It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan
So it looks like we start selling in the U  S  next year , Did Mr  Lin put you in charge of marketing ?
We aren't sure yet  Maybe L  A  I think L  A  would be the best idea , Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U  S  ?
Our computers have a high level of quality nowWe can demonstrate it  And our prices will be goodSo I think it will really be worthwhile , You seem excited about it
Yes   I do  I think we can compete  I think we can make a name for ourselvesIt will be hard at first  But if we develop a good advertising campaign   I think we can break into the market , The company will have to choose a good advertising firmAnd then there's the problem of qualityHow do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ?
That's very nice of you to sayBut if we set up an office there in the States   maybe you could try to become part of it , Me ? No way  I'm dedicated to the company   but I'm not going to leave Taiwan  I'm happy here
OK  Bye ! , No   wait   you will be too cold without mittens
Ok   see you after school , Oh  and ear muffs ! Put these on  here we go
I  I can ’ t breathe , There are some things I miss  But I love Chinese foodAnd I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitableBesides   I grew up in Los Angeles   so I'm used to living in crowded placesWhy are you going to America ?
Well   I know a lot of people have guns there  I think maybe it isn't too safe , Don't worry about itYour sister lives there  She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't goIt ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American citiesBut if your sister lives there   she must know the city pretty well already
I want to see the museums   and I want to shop a lot , The museums are excellent  And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there
This is very beautiful  Though I have to confess   I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! , That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it !
And that ? , It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there  We can milk them later
Relax   that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable , You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside  I ’ m going back to the city !
Well   think about it  We are a society that is always on the go   not because we have to   but because we want to , Why ?
What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it  It ’ s pointless , Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives
Yeah   yeah   whatever , Man   I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me !
What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! , I know  I know !
Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you , Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night  Are you OK ?
I was  It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare  I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home   like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family , Yeah   it can get pretty lonely over the holidays  When I first got here   I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home  I almost let it get to me   but then I started going out   keeping myself busy and before I knew it   I was used to to it
You know   I could really go for that  You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? , Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out  well kinda
Out of the frying pan and into the fire , Tom   aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ?
Whatever   I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs  Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! , Wow   American football is more exciting than I thought
The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked   but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone , Wow ! What a hit !
It looks like it   he ’ s getting up , I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team
Well   here we go again , What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ?
What are you so excited about ? , I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
There are tons of other paintings that I think are better , Maybe so   but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ?
Whoa , Here ’ s your hot dog and beer  What happened ? Did I miss anything ?
Well it was 3 to 4   but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base , So Baltimore is winning ?

Who are those guys ? , Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal   they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players
All right ! , Here comes Jordan   though
Which team do you think will win ? , The Lakers  Jordan is the only good player Washington has
How hard is the climb ? , It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet
Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun  I ’ m sorry I missed it , Well   you should come this weekend  I think you could do the climb
Hi   John   how was your vacation ? , Awesome   we went to Australia and New Zealand
Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? , A little   but the rush was worth it
500 feet ! I would never be able to do that , Yeah   It was scary   but exhilarating
Cool   give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud , Okay  A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ?
Wait  What ! , Have any plans for the weekend   Tom ?
I go as much as I can  I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature , It would be nice to get out of the city  Do you want some company ?
Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city , Yeah   my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest
Hey   Tom   what to go for a run ? , No thanks  I like to run in the morning  I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today
It ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; I ’ d rather run in the morning , Well   why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out
O  K    maybe if I have someone to go with   I ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog , Great   I ’ ll see you then
And we ’ re on the brink of soccer history today   as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup ! , The ref calls the players for the kick off   and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield   but   oath   it ’ s out of bounds
Delgado takes the corner  We have a foul ! Oh no   Did   the goalkeeper   has fouled the Ecuadorian player ! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick ! , This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions ! He gets ready for the kick  He shoots ! and he
I know ! Well  he said I ’ m not pregnant  I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing  I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose , Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you   not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of youAnd now that I ’ m with you again   I ’ m  I ’ m just scared   Veronica  The closer I get to you   the worse it gets  The thought of not being with you   I mean   I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other   Veronica  You are my everything   my soul mate  What can I do ?
The rings please  May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace   and continue in love until life ’ s end , With this ring I thee wed  Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment
That ’ s my index finger ! , Oh   right  This one   right ?

The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards !
What an amazing goal ! , I found a new job after all   and I like this one even better than the last
At the drop of a hat , What's bothering that guy ?
When pigs fly ! , That was a tough question  How did you get it right ?
Over my dead body you are ! , How was your business trip ?
Not at all   I was totally in the dark , I never understand why these shops have so much liquor
Well   it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it , You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ?
Well   it is different in different countriesBut it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal , Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?
Of course  Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily , Will you be at the family reunion next year ?
I tried it for a half-hourIt was interesting   but  well  I couldn't really do it , See ? I told you  It's very hard
Yes   it was really stupid , And how much did it cost to rent it ?
What do you mean ? It's expensive ! , Yes   but you have to calculate a littleYou paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty timesSo you only spent one dollar per fall  That's cheap
What are you planning to do today ? , I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach  I want to rent one
Can you take a little advice from a friend ? , Sure  What ?
Yes   but it takes a long time to learnYou would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer , Well   I will see  How was your day at the office ?
Which guy ? , The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window
Oh   I see him now  Wait ! That's , Yes   it's Mel Gibson
I can't do that , Why not ?
I don't want to lose all my money , Don't worry  You can't lose all your moneybecause you won't gamble all your money
Yes   I rememberYou must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play , That's right  That's the best way to have control over yourselfYou say to yourself  Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars  Only fifty dollars  No moreIf you follow the rule   you can't lose more than fifty dollars
Okay , So how much do you want to gamble ?
I don't want people to think I'm stingy , That is a bad attitude to have   Karen ! If you think that way   Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you
No   I'm sorry  I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxesIt is kind of disgusting , What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ?
Who knows ? Hey   I like these jade bears here , How much are they ?
Yes   but she would like this a lot  She likes to collect little things like this , Alright  Buy it then  I won't buy anything  Well   maybe I'll buy some Cognac
So how much should I gamble ? , Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ?
I want games that are all luck , I knew you would say that ! Then you should play the slot machines
BlackjackWe can play blackjack  And I will gamble one-hundred   or maybe two-hundred dollars , Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet !
so   I said   let ’ s take a breakAnd since that night   I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call   but I still haven ’ t heard from him  You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else   do you ? , Come on   don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine

What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon   ref ! , Don ’ t worry   Shan always screws up free throws
Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! , This ref needs glasses  Hey ref   open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that !
That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address  Pick me up at eight ? , Perfect !
What is it ? , I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day   but I was wrong  A twist of fate brought us together  I crashed into your life and you into mine   and this may sound crazy   but I ’ m falling in love with you   Veronica
Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat  no more chips   no more soda   no more fried food , I ’ Ve heard this one before
Thanks   honey   that was a great meal  I ’ m stuffed  Do we have any chips left ? , I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married !
Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? , That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer  I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephewOh   they look so cute !
Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? , Whoa   whoa   what ’ s going on ? Watch out !
Oh  I don ’ t know , I feel terrible   I really didn ’ t mean to knock you over  My tire   just exploded   and I lost control of my bike  Really   it was an accident  Please accept my apologies
Ouch ! My ankle ! I think it ’ s broken ! You can ’ t just leave me like this ! Are you calling an ambulance ? , Nope   I ’ m canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you
It's Friday  We should go party , I don't need to drink every weekend  I could be happy just staying home   you know
Yes ? Why not ? , AlrightAt least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends
So where should we go ? , Let's go to the Latin Club  I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend  Maybe it's Friday night
It's not all techno music  It's not a special techno night , No  But they play techno all the time  It drives me crazy after forty minutesAnd anyhow   if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance stepsAt the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hourAnd then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper  I know you
No  It was that friend of yours   MelissaHer and all her lousy country music Cds  Yecch ! , It's true  I would never go there again eitherCountry music is a nightmare  So is it the Latin Club ?
Maybe , Nick ! How ’ s it going ?
Actually   my office is right around the corner , It was great to meet you last week at the conference  I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment
You know what   this is really embarrassing   but your name has just slipped my mind  Can you remind me ? , Sure   my name is Ana Ferris  Don ’ t worry about it  it happens to me all the time  I ’ m terrible with names too
What were the schools like ? , Oh   I didn't actually teach in the schools  I taught after school  I taught in English institutes
They actually study after school ? , That's rightAfter their school day is over   they go to a special institute to study math or EnglishThey are very serious about learning over there
Asian cultures value learning very much  I know that , So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about educationThey would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing  I don't think that's a bad thing  I think it's a good thingIn America   too many parents don't pay attention
Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? , That's a stereotype we Americans haveWe think that Asian kids are very obedient and quietBut it's not true  There are plenty of naughty kids too
How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? , No   that would be too expensive  We used the train systemWe bought a special pass called a Enrail pass  It lets people use the train wherever they want   as often as they want
I know  Our train system is lousyAnd besides   Americans love their cars too much , I agree  And probably the automobile companies are too powerfulThey never allowed the government to develop trains
Yes   I agree  I think it is a cultural characteristicIt would be very hard to get us Americans to change thisBut you know what ? Probably   in the future   Americans will have to change , Why do you say " have to " ?
Wow ! I didn't notice the timeIt ' s almost noon  I have to get home , Do you want me to give you a ride ?
See you around , The hotel is full tonight  we will need to find a new place to stay
That's okay  Better late than never , Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ?
You can't judge a book by its cover , Those guys thought they would never lose  But we finally beat them  And look at them crying now
Me too  I get much more done when I am under the gun , There has been talk at school about canceling the concert
Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? , NoThe time we have spent apart has been good for usAbsence makes the heart grow fonder
It ’ s so relaxing   taking a walk in the country  The air is so fresh and clean , Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it
Well   I hate the noise in the city   but I love being around lost of people  The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet  The tow just don ’ t go together , I see what you mean  I love being far away from a city   but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities
I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face  When the wind blows in the city   you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes , The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing  There ’ s so sign of pollution  The village looks so peaceful
I ’ d love to have my own farm , It would be very hard work  Are you sure ?
That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it  I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office , You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer  It ’ s not something you can just walk into
What ’ s your city like ? , It ’ s quite an interesting place to live  The best thing to do in my city is go shopping  There are several indoor and outdoor markets   department stores and shopping malls
What about restaurants and entertainment ? , There are restaurants with food from all over the world  We have a small china-town near the city centre  There are many Indian   thai   and Italian restaurants all over the city centre  There are many s
It sounds like a really exciting city to live in , It is  I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon  You really should come during the summer   when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors
How did it grow into such a large place ? , Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here  The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre
I see  Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? , Oh   yes  Several of the buildings from the villages still survive  Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs  There was a castle near one village   so our city has a castle too
Sure  A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet  If you think about it   our space shuttles are UFOs , I've never thought about it like that before
I think there must be , Why is that ?
No   but we're trying to contact them , I suppose you're right
There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will   but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon , I haven't met you at the gym for a long time
it's not about pay raise or promotion  You know   I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night , then SOHO is your ideal work style
absolutely  I can decide when and what to do all by myself , sounds great  Are there many business opportunity ?
thank you for reminding me  I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project , Hello   Jim  What was the film like ?
It was about a married couple  They had to live with the wife's mother   because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own , A lot of young people have to do that
Yes   it does   doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired   and he couldn't sleepSo he used to take two sleeping pill every night , I take sleeping pills sometimes
Not really  His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter   because she could speak French and German fluently  After a few months ' work   she had a better job than her husband  So in the end , I don't know  My wife used to speak French  I must tell her to brush it up
Somewhere new  It's a great place to pick up chicks , Need a new  girlfriend   huh ?

OK   catch you later , What's the problem   Nada ? You look down in the dumps
but promise me   you'll keep it a secret , ok   I promise  So what's troubling you so much ?
no   of course not  He is still single , then what's your problem ?
worse still   he is trying to avoid me these days , office romance is very tricky
Mike   what are you doing tonight ? , Nothing special  I just want to get plastered
Yeah   but it's expensive  Nah   I'm going to YY's , On second thought   I think I'll join you
Quite a difference   huh ? , Sure is  Waiter   bring us two drafts   please
hi   Bob   I am so glad that you came , of course I'd come  I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends

You still with Jenn , yeah   Jenny and I got married right after graduation  It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet  I was supporting us both while she continued her studies  But now things are getting better
sounds great ! I'll be there , how's it going ?
what's wrong ? , there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around
you can ask her out for drink after work , but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am
you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her , but I always get tongue-tied when I see her
good luck ! , Hi   Mary  I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th   the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games  Is it true ?
yes   there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos   wedding dress   catering   transport   hotel   etc , is everything ready now ?
yes   we called   but it is booked up  The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet , it's an excellent hotel  A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect   though very expensive
thank you , my pleasure
are you doing anything this weekend ? , I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !
ok   well   my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday  We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere   so you could still sleep in  Do you want to come with us ? , that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
we've got plenty of inflatables   but if you want to sit on a chair   you'll have to bring your own sunlounger , I can just use my beach towel  I love lazing around in the sun
we've got a few  I can teach you how to surf on Sunday  It'll be fun ! , I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time  How much money should I bring ?
we'll pick you up at your place at noon  Be there or be square ! , have you ever been to Disneyworld ?
that's right  Why do you ask ? , well   I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon
congratulations ! I had no idea , thank you  So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can   you'll have a good time , even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
I'm sure he'll love the idea  Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! , Jack and Mary broke up
really ? I ’ m very surprised  He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing   right ? , no   he doesn ’ t  Anyway   she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time
he is an extrovert while she is an introvert  He likes parties while she hates them , poor Mary ! She really liked him
no   I don ’ t think so  I know Mary  Once she makes a decision   she won ’ t change her mind , I hope she ’ ll recover soon
I usually ride my bike  Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? , I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle   but when I feel lazy   I drive my car
cars might be convenient   but they're so bad for the environment , do you have a car ?
you could try  It would save you a lot of money , that's true  Every month   I spend hundreds of dollars on gas   insurance   and repairs
let's go to a car dealership  I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price , sounds good ! Let's go !
yes   I mean it , but why ? Did I do anything wrong ?
I have thought about it for a while  I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us , but I still love you
then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? , well  It ’ s not all my fault   Anna
I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart , shall we keep Our friendship ?
can't complain  What about you ? , not bad  Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ?
I heard they were just married for 5 months , yes   she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things
maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married , yeah  We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners
that's trueJust hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon , what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?
I don't know about that   but I do think that it helps people relax , what other kind of music do you listen to ?
what kind of music do you prefer then ? , I like pop music  Do you ?
how long have you been in to pop music   then ? , I've always been into it  Have you always liked classical music ?

how's it going ? , I'm in a really good mood   actually  How about you ?
well   my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night   but he never did , that's too bad  I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it  Don't be too upset about it
a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar , so what are you going to do about it ?
in the long run   I think breaking up with him would make me much happier   but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first , relationships can be confusing sometimes
so  what kind of things do you do in your free time ? , I'm really into watching foreign films  what about you ?

so what did you do about it yesterday ? , I went sky-diving !
weren't you scared ? , of course I was scared  But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped
I'm impressed , are you scared of anything ?
I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things , it sounds like you just need to be more careful
so   you're into 80s music then ? , well   I like all kinds of music   but he is one of my favorites  How about you ?
to be honest   no  I'm always in search of new music to listen to , do you often go to concerts ?

Just kidding   Mikel  Why don't you come work out with me ? , ah   I don't know a fit works  Last time   all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos   like me
This feels great  I'm all reed up  I can keep going all night , Not me  I'm too hot and I'm too tired
Thanks for coming   it was a real blessed , It wasn't as good as you think
I'm not surprised , What's the problem ?
I decided to put him up while he's here   big mistake ! , Why ?
You can say that again , So how long has he here for ?
good morning ! , good morning   Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ?
I feel much better   but I'm still worried about something , what's that ?
for me   traffic jams are quite stressful   because I'm pretty impatient  How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? , just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset
just one more thing  A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do , do you have any other plans this weekend ?
you're right  I probably should just work on my paper  Thanks ! , wow ! You're going to Tibet ?
great minds think alike  My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time  Do you have anything on your schedule ? , nothing particular
come on ! We're traveling on our own  It won't cost too much , ok   then count me in  where will we stay ?
I'll take care of it , and check whether they accept credit cards
I've been having a hard time sleeping lately , as far as I know   insomnia is usually caused by stress  Are you stressed at all ?
you're probably right  I just wish it were that simple  How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? , taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress
you ’ re right  I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class , besides   it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga  In fact   I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this   bend over and breath in deeply
what's wrong   Jerry ? You look so upset , to be honest   I was just dumped
come on  A trip will do you good  Are you doing anything this weekend ? , I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing
not very far from here  We'll fly  It's about one and a half hours , what's there to see ?
yes   the scenery there is breathtaking  I have some pictures at home  You can come over and take a look if you like , ok  Then I can make up my mind
oh   but I really need to leave this town for a change  Working day after day has worn me out  Do you have any other suggestions ? , we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away  How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places   and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
perfect  I'll start preparing tomorrow  If we're going to drive   I'll need to fill up the tank , no need  I think it's still plenty full  Even so   I'd rather travel by bus or train  It would cost much less than driving  Oil prices are soaring nowadays   you know
no problem  I'm really looking forward to the coming week , Me   too  Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us
great   let's go ! , hey   darling   I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day  I was so relaxed  It felt as if I were in another world
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach   stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant , are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
ok  I'll make the arrangements  It will be great , wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases
oh   that's exciting  What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? , well   I didn't think so at first  But as we started talking   I found his extremely funny and witty  I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common  We like the same teams   music   a
well   that's something I've never heard of  But if you as me what I value most in a friend   I would have to say honesty , I agree  You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person  Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need
no idea  We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights  What else is there to see ? , what about a factory tour ?
good idea ! I've always been interested in that  How much is the entrance fee ? , I'm not sure   but as far as I know   most factory tours are free  They are sponsored by the company providing the tour
oh   i see  So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors , exactly
excuse me   is this the way to the Greta Wall ? , oh   it is really far from here  You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually
and then ? , take the next right  Drive about one click further   and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall
by the way   how long does it take ? , without traffic   it takes about an hour
great ! Thank you ! , my pleasure   and have a good time !
is she American ? , yeah   and most importantly   she's single ! Man   I could tell from the moment I saw her   she's the girl of my dreams !
sounds like you've got some competition  You made a move already ? , not yet  But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime  I know some good restaurants nearby
good luck ! , thanks !
did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? , yes   that was the first thing we did  We went all the way to the top  There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there
you must have had a great time , yes   at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun  However   on the third day of traveling in the city   I felt sick  I think I had something bad to eat   but it passed by the evening
that is great  Everyone says French food is wonderful , you'll have to try for yourself some day
yeah   that's her  We had a lot of wonderful times together  She is really a special friend   and I want to get her something meaningful , I am not good at picking gifts  Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ?
hmm   I think I've got an idea  Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home , a plant ? That's creative  I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you  But there is a problem  Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ?
who are you writing a letter to ? , I'm just responding to Sue's letter  Do you want to help ?
well   maybe you could tell them about my promotion , you've been promoted ? when did that happen ?
shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? , ah  That can wait  Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time !
I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June , that's thoughtful of you
what would you do without me ? , we do balance each other out well  I guess we were really made for each other !
I'd like to  It's a cell phone   camera   PAD and mp3 player all in one , if I had enough money   I'd buy one   but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods
how many gigs of music can it hold ? , I think it's either one or two gigs  I can't remember
you're right   that's not bad at all , do you have an iPod ?
that's one of the problems with having an iPod  Though an iPod might have an above average battery life   once the battery is dead   so is your iPod , what are you looking for ?
not really  I thought I'd just have a look today , would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ?
it's very light  That would be good  How is the battery life ? , it's got an above-average battery life  It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes
how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? , yes  I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark
how does that compare with other models ? , there are models that can pick up more sound than this one   but they're much bigger and heavier than this one
not much  I'm just trying to hook up to the internet  I'm having a few problems though , what's wrong ?
actually   I've got a wireless connection , In that case   you need to turn on your airport
No   but I'd like to  Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? , Oh   no  You can register for free  Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it
what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list , it's aubreyinchina@yahoocom
You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today ! , what's that ?
no   I thought I'd wait until you got home , go on   read it out loud
just a few weeks ago  Sue and I send letters to each other often , I didn't know anyone did that any more  Ok   go on
oh  It's actually all rather personal , well   skip over all of that and read me the rest
didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June , oh   I guess I missed that
yes   it's my new business phone  Do you like it ? , it's very impressive  Can you use the Internet on your phone ?
yes   but I don't really use it that often  Have you ever used it ? , no   but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go
of course it does  Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? , I guess so  Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client
no   why ? , I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message
no   it's ok  Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later , I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone
how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? , it's not that bad  It kind of feels like I'm on vacation   not having to answer my phone all the time !
I like playing computer games   but I'm not really into board games , how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ?
how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? , I didn't really have to figure it out  I just followed the instructions !
it's a deal , do you remember   years ago   when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ?
I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo , if you don't start when you're young   it's hard to get the hang of it
how did your interview go ? , pretty well  I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not   but I feel good about it
will you get a pay-raise   too ? , whenever you are given added responsibilities   you should get a promotion
what kinds of questions did she ask you ? , she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be
those are good answers  How did she react ? , she told me that even when I become a senior engineer   I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team
you're lucky  Not everyone has such a great boss ! , that's true  She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company
could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? , sure
I try very hard  The problem is   my salary just isn't enough to live on  Now that I have a wife and a child to support   we hardly have enough money for food and rent , there are trying times for everyone  What do you propose ?
listen   if you give me a raise   I'll take on extra responsibilities , that sounds reasonable  How about this   from now on   you can be responsible for scheduling  That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift   then you'll have to do it
that sounds good to me  I really appreciate it , you are welcome  Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling
don't I know you ? , yes   now that you mention it   I think we had a chemistry class together in high school
I went straight to university afterwards  What about you ? , I took a year off to go travelling
I went to a small school in Connecticut  It has a very good reputation for its languages department , Oh   did you study a foreign language ?
it is   but it's very rewarding , so you can speak Chinese ?
hello  Where are you headed today ? , I'm off to Barcelona for a week
fortunately for you   you don't  Next time   if you have any questions about visas   you should try to find out before you get to the airport , that's good advice
let me see here  yes   there's one left , ok  I'll take that one then
if that's your only piece of luggage   it is small enough to carry on with you  Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? , yes   please  That's a fantastic idea  Which gate do I need to go to ?
oh , don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ?
the train ? Will I be flying back then ? , oh   no  We've brought your return ticket for you  I think you'll find it comfortable
when is the first meeting then ? , they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning  That should give you enough time to have a quick shower
that's very sensible  Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? , that's not a problem  Have a nap if you can  You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip
where are you planning on going ? , I fancy going to Tibet for a few days  Have you ever been there ?
personally   I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time  A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital , you ’ re probably right  What do you think about Yangshao ?
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing  I heard they are very relaxing , I guess if I only have a few days   I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away
Hey   Frank   there is that Janet Check , Wow   what a great burd !
And look out she's dressed , Yeah   I noticed  She must be really loaded
I think you've lost it , Well   that's my opinion
At least we agree on that  Let's go and get a drink , welcome back ! How was your vacation ?
because it's off-season   we got a really good package deal to Paris   so we went there , I've always wanted to go to Paris  The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?
oh   that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling  I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city , you don't look very happy in that picture
we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market  We had a few coffees   watched a movie   and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel , my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing  Did you go to the Louvre ?
hi   how are you doing ? , everything's great  And you ?
oh   really ? I saw it two years ago  It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking , yeah  I found it is so close to our life
well   it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too , I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married
I can't agree more  The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage , definitely  They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously
Oh   hi   Jessica   are you going to see this movie too ? , I'd love to   the movies are smash hit
I'll say the movie's starting in the minute , I know  I wonder what's keeping him
What's he trying to pull anyway , I don't know  But this is definitely the last straw
more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners , that's true  But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners
I wouldn't say that's totally true  I've met many happy intercultural couples , well   then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ?
what do you mean ? , you know   usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl
you have a point here   but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love , that ' for sure but very few
not yet  But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent , let me guess   your parents want you to marry a Chinese man   right ?
oh   how did you deal with it ? , I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend  But finally we broke up
like what ? , he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family
so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner , not really  There are many successful mixed marriage around us
but we've done that many times  We want something fresh this time , okay   let me think  What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room   invite a band to play some music   order in some food and watch a movie later
I don ' t think so  I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come  But we certainly can cut costs in other ways   such as make the party BYOB , BYOB ? What's that ?
maybe you have a point  How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early   order some pizza   and serve drinks  There'll be music but no band  Having the party in the office will make , oh   that sounds like fun !
pretty good  My colleagues seem alright  So far everything is great , that's nice  What do they have you doing over there ?
indeed  Team work is highly valued in this new company  I like our boss too  He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation  He's highly respected by all his employees , that's great   that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees  I wish my boss was like that
yeah it is , hi   Natasha   how's life ?
my immediate family is very large  It's my mother   my father   my two older brothers   my younger sister and me , I have a small family  They are my parents   my younger brother and me
interesting  What do you think about families with only one child ? , the child must feel very longly  My younger brother is 10 years younger than me  Before he was born   I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da
you are very lucky to have such a nice family , thank you
I'm with you on that  Check out that one over there  I think I'm in love ! , well   she's alright   but not really my cup of tea  What about the blond with the red dress ?
I bet  Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice , I don't think so  I get so nervous talking to girls  I always put my foot in my mouth   scare her off   and end up looking like a real fool  Besides   she is way out of my league
all right  But I think you ought to move soon , why ?
good luck ! , do you have internet in your room ?
well   there are a lot of things   like reading news   email   shopping   etc  but mostly I chat online  You could say I'm addicted to online chatting , I never chatted online before  What's it like
to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals  See   the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world  You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were , that's amazing  I will install an online messenger program when I get home
ORG ! It must be so late where you are  What time is it ? , just after 2 am
really ? What is it ? , I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ?
just give me the dates and I'll make sure I'm free  You know after all these chatting online   it will be great to meet you in real life  I look forward to seeing you soon ! , me too  But I think I am going to bed now  my head is getting heavy  Have a nice day there !
hi   Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? , well   I spend a lot of time watching movies
actually   I watch whichever movie there is   be it a comedy   a sci-fi or a suspense movie  How about you ? , art films are my favorite   but thrillers are cool   too
how often do you go to the cinema ? , once in a while   I suppose   I usually rent movies at Movie Salon
is it good ? , yes   you can find almost all new releases there
hello   Jason   there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow  I plan to go to see it , is it a horror movie ?
that's funny   I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside , Hey   how could you like to taste my fist ?
that is to say   you like all genres except for horror movies , yeah  It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned
really ? I haven't heard of it , well then   this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together  I bet you'd love it
I had a drop too much last night  I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine  And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table , you have it right  Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China  Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship   especially in Northern China
a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night   crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood , then he must be opening his heart to the friends  In a word   as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort   no one will jeer at you
really ? Where did you hear that ? , I met with the supervisor just this morning  I don't know   but I am a little worried  Who do you think will get sacked ?
that's true  What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her , Lisa ? No way  I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair  You know rumors can't come out from nowhere
well   it could be me too  But I am not too worried  This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning  It would almost b , The band is pretty good  How do you like the music ?
of course  But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , don't worry  I'm not much of a dancer myself
when did you learn to dance ? , in college  But I don't dance very often  What's your favourite dance ?
oh   I like it  It's such a beautiful dance   but I can't do it well  What about you ? , Tango is my favorite  Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot
ok , I really admire you   Diana
I work very hard and that's it   you know   practice makes perfect , isn't there anything else ?
well   Jerry   let me tell you a secret , go ahead
maybe I've got a higher EQ  I'm not sure , well   perhaps you're right  Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ
let's go ! , hi   I'm Lucas   I just moved in next door
would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice , thanks  Some tea would be nice  Chinese tea is great  I really like your tea set  Where did you get it ?
you are right about that  It's quiet and very convenient  You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk  There's a grocery store   a book store   a gym   and many restaurants , there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible  I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight
what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? , to be honest   I wouldn't
what's the puzzle ? , my husband and I prefer to have no kids   but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids
oh   really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren , but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not
don't worry  I think in most cases   children are the glue that keeps a family together , I guess you're right  But I still prefer to have no child
I have   actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself , what would it be like ?
I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each   and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite  I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t , how many bedrooms would your dream home have ?
I don ’ t like a lot of clutter   so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out  I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls   but other than that   most things would b , how many TVs would your dream home have ?
that would be a good shot  Can you take my picture here   dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well , all right  Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good  Smile  Say " cheese "  OK   got you  That's terrific
now let's have one together , do you know how to set the timer ?
cheese , did it come out ?
Ok   let's go , finally we're on board !
let me see  yes   one window seat and one aisle seat , ok  But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window  I'm a terrible flyer  I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed
I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment   and the others can go under the seat , good idea
yes ! , and no hijackers
no  please sit down , thanks
I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there  Have you ever been there before ? , yes   I went there once last summer
was it that crowded ? , yes  There were always so many people  After taking the subway during the rush hour   you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans
thank you very much ! , Hello   Ms  Barkley  How are you ?
Very well   thank you   Mr  Parker , Hi   Jim  How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while
I was in New York for a wedding , Matthew ? Hi !
how have you been ? , I'm pretty good  I've been looking for a place to live recently  My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it
well   maybe I can help  Remember my neighbor ? , Mrs  Thou ?
I'll ask Mrs  Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know  Has your number changed ? , what's your apartment like ?
it's not as bad as I thought it would be  The freshmen that live nearby are really loud   especially on the weekends  But   the rent is much cheaper than private housing   so it's worth it , did you have to pay a deposit ?
no   it's all included  Besides   students don't have to pay council tax   so we're saving quite bit of money by living here , how long is your contract for ?
not yet  I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer , Good luck !
but you two used to do everything together  I thought you really enjoyed each other's company , we did   but since she started her new job   all she does is hang out with her new friends from work
maybe you should invite her over for dinner   so it's just the two of you , I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her
she's probably just excited about her new job  You should give her some time  It would be a shame to lose such a good friend , I've given her enough time  I'm over it now
what was your wedding ceremony like   Abigail ? , my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses  But then we had three parties to celebrate
were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? , I would have liked them to be there   but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us   and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them   so they understood
that makes sense  Did you go on a honeymoon ? , we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa
Mary   how was your date with john ? , it's ok  It seems we have a lot in common
sounds like he is pretty cute  What do you think of him ? , he is a nice guy and very considerate  I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor
maybe he is busy with his work  Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! , oh   steve  Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ?
that's what friends are for , you are dressed to kill  You look gorgeous   Alexander
she's a friend of Amy  We met at Amy's birthday party , is this your first date ?
oh  so you buried the hatchet with Steven ? , absolutely not ! He's a cheater  I will never talk to him again  I'm over with him  He's history !
really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? , please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday
hey   Isabelle , Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true
let me explain  I didn't mean to hurt you , how dare you !
I didn't lie  You just didn't ask me my real name , I should have known it was you  No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly  I thought I might have found the one for me
waiting for someone , you mean the boy you met on MSN ?
I know   but I keep thinking of him every day  And I get really depressed when he's not online , I think it's just a crush  You can't be serious
yes  He said I'm his dream girl , you shouldn't take it too seriously  It might be a lie
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? , I don't think dieting is good for you  It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !
so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? , sure   they can eat some chocolate  As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods   there's nothing wrong with having a small desert
that's good advice  Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? , my mother used to make me take vitamins every day   but I don't take them anymore  Vitamins are good as a supplement   but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start
I feel absolutely horrible  My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius   and I've got a headache and a runny nose , do you have any other symptoms ?
yes   for the most part  It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments   anyway , how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ?
I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago , you haven't had much luck lately   have you ?
I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch , I think it's time you took another does of each  What would you like to drink with them ?
that sounds good , soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick  I hope it makes you feel better   too
do you feel ok ? , not really  After a 12 - hour flight   I've got jetlag   and on top of that   I think I've also got the flu
you're really hot  Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down , ok  I'll stay home this morning and rest   but if I feel better in the afternoon   I'm going to the meeting
it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? , just cats   but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks
we would   but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse , whatever you say  I just want to get to my meeting !
I'm starving   so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions , that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions  Do you want to go there ?
I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there  But   they've westernized their food   so it's not actually that spicy , you're right  Most of their dishes have sweet sauces  We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? , they'll still charge us a corkage fee
are you sure ? We could go Dutch , no   I'll pay  It's my turn anyway  You paid last time
that depends  What is it ? , it's kind of a big favor  I'm absolutely flat broke   and I owe my landlady $ 200  she's given me until Friday to give it to her   but I don't get paid until next Monday  Do you think you could loans
let's see   I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend  I can only spare about $ 20  I would give you more if I had it   I just don't have much money to my name right now , thanks a lot Ayden  Every little bit will help  Tell you what   if you aren't doing anything tonight   why don't you come over and have dinner at my place
see you then ! , are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ?
we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice , that's what I thought you would do  Listen   I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood  It's just down the street from all the bars  You probably don't want to be walking around after dark
really ? I never would have guessed  The criminals must only come out in the evenings   because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime , do me a favor   and take a taxi  It'd make me feel a lot better
has anything else happened to you ? , nothing else has happened to me   but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close
sure  My mom has been working on our family tree for years  She ’ s always updating it , do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it
I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side , are you very close to your first-cousins ?
it ’ s definitely my mother  And   her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family , that ’ s interesting  What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ?
Hey   Teresa   meet the new neighbors yet ? , Actually   i popped in them last night
I'll say   she is really stacked   isn't she ? , Yeah   she is a neck-off for sure
Ah-ha   I thought so , Anyway   that is not what I meant by beautiful
That's right , Yeah  I think things are worked out just fine
it's got its own library   theatre   swimming pool   and a guest house  The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through , would you want to live there ?
my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England , would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?
no   that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! , I see  If you lived in an old house   would it be decorated in a modern way ?
It's the new neighbor  I hate her guts , I've never seen you so worked up  what did she do to you ?
Of course   I am sure , You shall go easy on her  she is new here
I've tried   but she keeps pushing my buttons , Try to pull it together   Vernassa  I am sure things will turn note   ok ?
Thanks   Serena , How many people are there in your family ?
15 people , Wow  That is a very big family  Do you all live together ?
Right   but that's where my heart is  But you're right   now there are only 14 living at home , My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house
My aunts and uncles are all teachers , You are so lucky !
I agree  Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English  All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English , 800 books ? I'm impressed !
everything's great  I've just returned from my office , your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ?
yeah   an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies  I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building , what kind of services do they offer ?
I get a business address at an expensive location   and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor , oh   that helps a lot to promote your corporate image
Sure  We love each other and take care of each other , In such a big family   there must be a head  Who's the head of your family ?
No  Not anymoreMine is highly educated but traditional family  Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller  In traditional families   the old people are well respected and taken good care of  Ho , My family setup is a bit different  In New York city   there're only three people   my mother   my stepfather and me  During this summertime   I fly out to California and live with my dad  Dad's getting
Yours is a modern family  I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer  You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys , But four boys !
It is good to have goals in life  If California doesn't work out   come and visit me in Korea   OK ? , That's a great idea !
Can you play baseball with me today ? , No   I can't  I'm sorry  I have to help my mother  We're going to move tomorrow

We must go to a dance soon   or we'll forget how to dance , Yes   we must  What have you been doing since I last saw you ?
Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ? , I hope to visit Japan next year
A good idea  They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! , Did you watch television last night   Charles ?
Oh   I didn't watch the football match  I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film , What a pity  It was quite exciting  Both teams played very well
It was quite good  But  I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first , Did your wife enjoy it ?
Can't you stay for a little bit longer   it's only 8 , I wish I couldBut I'm afraid I can't  I've got some serious studying to do  I have to go
You tooThanks for dropping in , Good morning   Sue
Things couldn't be betterWhere are you going now ? , I am heading for the library  I've got a research project to doHow about you ?
After a while   crocodile , Hi   John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages
Just fine  How is everything with you ? , Not bad  I finally bought a house  It ’ s an old one   but built really solid  It is close to here  Do you want to come over for lunch ?
That ’ s a deal , I heard that you moved to Florida
The shuttle launches are beautiful  I saw one that took off at midnight  The whole sky got bright , Sounds great !
I ’ Ve been to all of them , I ’ m jealous  I ’ Ve never been to Florida
I hope you do  And keep in touch   OK ? , I sure will
Thank you  I ’ d better get going  I don ’ t want to be late for lunch  Mom would worry , Well   I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other  Have a good trip

I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides , what do you usually write about ?
it's random  If there happen to be a lot of things going on   I may add several new entries in a week   and if I've got nothing to share   I may leave my blog untouched for weeks , got it  Are you still updating your blog ?
not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock  I can't believe it ! , can't bear it   right ? I've been there before  I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages   like there is something missing
addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! , yes   it is  Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ?
yeah   it's a must  Otherwise   I may miss important phone calls and text messages , do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ?

I didn't like it  Not a bit  I couldn't stand the music  Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep , I noticed that   it was not exciting as I expected   but the music was great  I'm always found Jazz  And that movie had a lot of Jazz

Oh   I don't know  I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids   I suppose  But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money , One thing's certain  If I had a lot of money   I wouldn't work any more
What would you do after that ? , Oh   I don't know  It'd take me a long time to go round the world
I'd be happy if I got a rise , And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat
I'll have a pint of the best , I'd have a Scotch if I were you  We deserve it
I'm going to stay in the city , What will you do all day ?
No   but I can learn  What are you going to do this summer ? , I'm going to camp  I've gone to camp for four summers

I'm going to be a clerk , What does a clerk do ?
A-what ? , A vet-a veterinary surgeon
I once read a story about a person who talked to animals  It was very interesting , who is your favorite NBA star ?
He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers   but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand , Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ?
who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him , well then   what are your spoils ?
Well  this one costs more   but it has a much better soundThis part of it is made of wood   not plastic  And there's a tone control   too , I only want it for the kitchen  I like to listen to the news at breakfast time
Certainly , Hello   Mrs Turnbull  How are you ?

He appeals to the fans thanks to two things , you mean he plays well ? Yeah   he often scores by free kicks in crucial games  But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks
yes   his face looks are manly   with a straight nose and infinite eyes  As a man of medium height in the West   he keeps a powerful but elegant figure   looking neither lanky nor stout , and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent

yeah  Maybe we can change to another channel  what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on , okay  Nope   it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain
oh   what is it ? , it's a total rip-off of an American reality show   but the imitation is unbearably clumsy
I don't get it  We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV   get outside   and do something real , cool
what ? , I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people  I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China   but

Really ? What's the series about ? , well   it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America  It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny  I think you'd like it

sure  Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality , as far as you could see   is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
certainly  After all   I've been here for two years  It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils  Though   I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch , yes   table etiquette  There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told  Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners   while they are the norm i
oh   sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks , I heard that ben is forming his own band
I can play drums   but I haven ’ t played for a while  I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band , I wish I could play a musical instrument  I love music
you know   you could probably get a computer program that would help you  You already have a computer   so you could use that to help you mix some music , that ’ s a great idea  I ’ ll search for some information on the internet  If it ’ s possible to do   the internet will have some information about it

I like music that has a fast beat and is lively   like dance music  You know   I go to a disco almost every week  Sometimes it ’ s too loud though  You prefer classical music   don ’ t you ? , yes   I do  I find it very relaxing  I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work
really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often  I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress , yes  That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings  I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework
that ’ s a good idea  You should do the same with some music  You might find something you like  Classical music might make you clever   but dance might make you livelier and happier , that ’ s true  There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people  Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character
why ? I think cats are ok , I can ’ t bear being near cats  They don ’ t seem to like me either
I think bears are wonderful  Pandas are fantastic  I low the people who kill them for their fur , I agree  I ’ m carry about mice  I think they ’ re so cute !
not really  Sometimes   I even let other people make key decision for me , what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ?
that ’ s a good idea  You ’ re very decisive   I ’ Ve noticed  So   which bar are we going to this evening ? , I can ’ t make a decision  You ’ ll have to put forward an idea
I find it really hard to express myself in class  I have lots of ideas   but they never seem to come out of my mouth , let me give you a little advice  You know what the topics are going to be   so prepares what you would like to say in advance
I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense , we could chat about the topic before class  I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking
I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy , the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say  They will reply to your statements   but you can ’ t be sure how

How are the children doing at sport ? , I ’ m very pleased with their performances  Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds  That ’ s very fast for a kid his age
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? , The longest race we run is the 1500 meters  A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters , I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !
how do you usually spend your day   now that you ’ Ve retired ? , well   I nearly always get up at dawn  I don ’ t like sleeping in late  The days are longer in summer that in winter   so I get up in summer  I usually do some exercise when I get up
that sounds nice  How do you spend your mornings ? , I usually do housework in mornings  I go shopping occasionally  I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket  I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center  It takes about
I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening  It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features , Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed
No   it isn ’ t  it ’ s a pity   because I ’ d like to see it in action , So would i  what other unusual plants did they show ?
That ’ s right  That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species , I see  The plants that fascinate me most are cacti  I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions
Which sports are popular in your country ? , Most people like football  More boys like football than girls  A few girls play it really well  Some people like playing basketball
In my country   many people enjoy golf   but it is too expensive for some people  A few people like extreme sports   but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them , Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people  Several people from my university enjoy them   but most of us just watch  No one I know plays golf
There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too , Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ?
The summers are hotter  The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years  There have also been stronger winds , I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment

Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine , It is in mine tooThe biggest issue is water  The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important
I see  I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution , Yes   I agree  The air here is much more polluted than in my country  Of course   my country is more agricultural and has much less industry
I think you ’ re right  There needs to be an international response to this problem , What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ?
What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go  Besides   some people would still hunt them  Meat has become an integral part of our diet , We could provide them with better conditions anyway  We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos  We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible
I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced , That ’ s good news  The good thing is that most people treat their pets well
Yes   I have  They do an excellent job , What are the seasons like in your city ?
We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks   but apart from that   summers are dry  Thunderstorms make the air fresh again   so most people don ’ t mind then , What are spring and autumn like ?
Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? , No   I don ’ t  I go on a winter holiday instead  I go somewhere warm
I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action   but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late , We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere  There ’ s lots of clean   modern technology   but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive  Developing countries
It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains  Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people , Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment
I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride  I love being out in the fresh summer air  How about you ? , I don ’ t often go for walks   but I either play sports outside-you know   tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book
I think most people do  I like wearing nice   colorful clothes in summer-you know   a nice dress or skirt  It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter , Yes  I like wearing shorts in summer  My legs would freeze !
I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose  It was very interesting , I love dogs  They have been used as guards for centuries  Nowadays   they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers
Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts , Can you ride a horse ?
What a good idea ! , What's the weather like in your city ?
What are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees , In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below thatthe streets are often icing in the morningwith high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms
Yes   they are  like i said we have thunderstormsbut each one usually only last a few hoursthen the skys are clear again , Have you ever had snow in your city ?
As you know   my city is on the coastthe water is also not cleanbut people still go swimming all year around  i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny , Both our countries are quite small  How would you describe the landscape in your country ?
Pretty much  The land rises and falls only a few meters  The southeast   the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters  There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country , Yes   there are  They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries
There are many lakes and rivers in your country too  We also have many rivers   but only a few lakes , We also have waterfalls in the mountains  They make the landscapes look very scenic  The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion   especially by water
It ’ s the same in my city  We also have a lot of drug addicts  A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs , That happens in many places  In my city   there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme  The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes   but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for
That ’ s possible   but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that , Which countries have you been to ?
No   but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon  I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries  Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? , I think I ‘ d say norway  It has many picturesque fjords   waterfalls   and mountains
I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries   but not to Norway  Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there , When in Rome   do as the Romans do   they say
In other words   the Romans do what everyone else does , Yes   but they do it differently  Everything is different
I envy them the sun , I know  You hate the rain   don't you ?
They always eat spaghetti and drink wine   don't they ? , Not always  But they like a good meal  Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food   you know
Hello   Jim  Where are you going ? , To the cinema  What about coming with me ?
Do you go to the cinema a lot ? , Once a week  Most nights I sit at home and watch telly

My prize was for the best player in the country  Now let's start playing chess seriously , What was the party like last night   Jean ?
What a shame  Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? , I don't like them  I used to take them when I had to work overtime   you know
Good heavens  Why did you take so many ? , Because I was under a terrible strain  The doctor saidthey weren't very strong  Anyway   I used to feel awful the next morning
He was quite right , So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead
It's not that hot  It's cooler than yesterday  Let's go swimming ! , That's a thought  It's still early   and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day  If we don't stay too long   we won't get sunburned
Who cares ! Well   the smart guys get there early  That's the kind of guy I want to meet  Let's go ! , If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini   then I want to wear one   too
No problem  Here it is , When was America discovered   Tony ?
In a way that's right  But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus  And what about the Red Indians ? , All right  Ask me a question now
Correct  Now for a harder question  Who will be the first men on Mars ? , I can't answer that  But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century
That's easy  It's  er  Venus  NO  Pluto  No  Wait a minute  It's Anthe tip of my tongue  Oh dear   what is the nearest planet to the sun ? , It's a beautiful day   isn't it ?
It's beautiful 75 degrees , How nice  I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week  I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend
I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning  Then after listening to the weather temperature   I make my plans , That's smart  I'm going to start doing the same thing
Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky  How are you going there ? , By air   of course  It takes over two weeks to go by sea
For a short time  One of the engines caught fire , What did the pilot do ?

Perhaps that had something to do with it , You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ?
Well    perhaps you should think about it , Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ?
Hmm  Perhaps it should be the only important thing  But it isn't  Not in this company , I had broken up with him   how painful I feel  I ’ m going to drown my sorrows
sure  A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet  If you think about it   our space shuttles are UFOs , I've never thought about it like that before

I have a large family  I have three older sisters   my twin sister   a younger brother   and my parents , I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ?
We used to be really close   but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai  How about your family ?

Sounds like it was ment to be , Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ?
What's so interesting about it ? , Well   this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up   half his face had been bitten off !
Wow  What does his look like now ? , It looks pretty frightening  He doesn't have any lips   so all you can see are his gums and teeth  Most of his nose and chin are missing too
What's he going to do now ? , It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant   but until then   he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask
What was your childhood like ? , I had a pretty strict up-bring   and my parents and I were always fighting about it
Where did you go to university ? , My parents wanted me to stay in Hongkong   but I decided to go back to England   I graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English literature

Are you writing a book now ? , Yes   it ’ s about a group of friends living in a foreign country   and all the strange experiences they have
My husband and I have thought about it   but we've decided not to have any  They're just too expensive  Besides   with all the news about global warming on the news lately   who knows what kind of Worl , Well   I've always wanted to have lots of children  Growing up with only one brother   I always felt a bit lonely  What do you think about families with only one child ?
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7  You know   I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home  What do you think fo the one-child policy , If China didn't have such a policy   can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
I don't know what other people think   but I   for one   envy only children ! , I don't know about you   but I'm famished  Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ?
You're a woman after my own heart  I don't know many people who can handle spicy food  Are you sure you are up for hotpot , Sure  If I could   I would eat hotpot every day !
Let me think about it for a minute  Let's see  oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me , Well  ? Have you thought of it yet ?
That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! , You really have a bid head   don't you !
Well   she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair , How tall is she ?
Not at all  She's actually very athletic , It sounds like she's pretty good-looking  Does she wear glasses ?
She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose , Does she have any piercings or tattoos ?
It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one , Even her mom ?
She's a lot like me , So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true !

I'm fine   thanks  And you ? , Very well   thanks  Nice to see you again  I haven't seen you for a long time  What have you been doing lately ?

I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes  I ’ m sure , You ? You are full of hot air

Oh   I forgot , Get on the phone right now  It might not be too late
I ’ m on it ! , What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ?
Romantic ? I can ’ t remember what that word means , Well   you have three kids   so you knew what it meant once upon a time !
I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle  Whenever I get the time   I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper , you really like brains that make you think   don't you ?
doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? , well   I like to play darts  Whenever I go to a bar   I usually play for a few hours
do you still like playing those games ? , not at all  I never really did   to be honest  What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ?
no   I prefer to play with people I know , how about mah-jong ?
I hate to disappoint you   but unlike what most people think   we aren't all exactly the same ! , so   which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ?
I used to play basketball when I was little   and I never scored a goal  Every time I watch a basketball game   I think about how horrible I was at it , that makes sense
have you ever seen a live game ? , sure   many times  It's an exciting game for spectators to watch
thanks   that'd be nice  When's the next ice hockey game on ? , not for a while   but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you
what did you do last night ? , I just stayed at home and watched TV
what were the results of the game ? , it ended in a tie
really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win  They are a much better team than Madrid , if Barcelona had played as they normally do   they should have won
that explains it , how many more games are left this season ?
in a few weeks  Are you planning on watching them ? , of course ! I really love watching football games on TV
Ok   it's a date then ! , Congratulations on the new house !
I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! , do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ?
really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? , I didn't see the crash itself   but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building
did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ? , yes   my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers
I'm sorry  That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family , it was  The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own
no   what's it about ? , apparently   she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity
I'd believe it  She owns magazines   television shows and she has a huge fan base , you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa
that's really commendable  I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has , I agree  So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars   expensive clothing   and luxurious hotels
did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? , no   but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend
they're also one of the richest couples  They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want , I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars
Tom Cruise may be handsome   but I think he's a bit crazy   don't you ? , yes   his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you , that's true  I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! , exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment
I know what you mean  However   there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming  If it's not the pollution   then it's the natural disasters   deforestation   or the greenhouse , what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
they're related to one another   yes , I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live
I think if everyone pitches in   the world will be a better place , what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ?
I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat  I figure that if they're homeless   they're probably hungry , that's a good idea  Do they usually accept the food ?
the cost of living in London is just too high for most people , it's true  The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment
added to that is the high unemployment rate right now , something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon
what happened ? Why didn't he win ? , didn't you hear ? He was disqualified
what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? , he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster
that's so disappointing  I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs , I don't think it's right   but I can understand why they might  Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
let's hope so , what are you watching on the telly ?
the office  Have you watched it ? , I've seen the British version and loved it   but have never seen the American version
they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now , I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated
we have digital TV  It's amazing though---even with 100 channels   there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch ! , do you watch a lot of TV then ?
there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch  Do you want to stay and watch it with me ? , why not ? I don't have anything better to do !
I think you're being a little critical  The actor in the lead role is fantastic  I suppose the chorus could be a bit better   though , do you know anyone in the play ?
that's only part of it  I absolutely adore this director  Every play he works on turns out great , so you've seen other plays that he's directed ?
I've never had a part in a play before   but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school , what did you do ?
why not ? , I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat
yes   I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once  The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over , do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ?
where are you from ? , I'm from the plains of the Midwest  It's a prime location for tornadoes
wow   that must have really been scary , actually   some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass
that sure didn't last long ! , did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?
do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? , no   I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions
what do you think about abortion ? , I personally would never want to have one   but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life   she should have the right to decide for herself
why not ? It's their children   too , that may be true   but when a woman gets pregnant   it changes her life completely  Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand
What's that ? , How many planets are there in the solar system ?
Nice try  I wasn't born yesterday   you know , I'm dead serious  They've decided that it's too small to be a planet   but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore
I suppose you're right  They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them   not the other way around , We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos
Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? , I hope not  I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on Earth
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? , while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking   but I don't really care for the advertisement
it's a pun  They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking , I know   but I think it's not really appropriate for young children
perhaps you're right     though  Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow , I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults   but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them
have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ? , I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table
it's Martin Scorsese  You liked his film   The Departed   didn't you ? , yes   it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ?
no  I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile , how much does the magadize cost ?
Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership   but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore , I bet you'll still buy it   though  You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !
well   you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader   right ? , yes
she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back , wow ! That's really great news  How often does the magazine come out ?
yes   but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! , do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?
me   too  Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? , sure   where would you like to go ?
I've never really thought about it before  I guess it doesn't bother me , do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ?
it's a lovely day out today   isn't it ? , it's beautiful  Enjoy it while it lasts  It's supposed to get cold tomorrow
that doesn't sound pretty , do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
I suppose I should  I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions  Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? , I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon
that sounds like fun , hey   look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
not really  I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie  Do you want to go with me ? , sure  What movies were you thinking about going to ?
that's the one  It's an actioncomedy  What do you think ? , to be honest   I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead  Besides   I like movies with a happy ending best
isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? , yeah   I suppose you wouldn't want to see that   huh ?
Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen , that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ?
sounds good  I'll see you then ! , so   have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ?
yeah  Even though the customs were brilliant   I didn't think it was as good as the first two  What did you think ? , I thought the special effects were amazing   but I got a bit confused  The plot was too complicated for me
yes   I've read them many times  I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters , yes   trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me
that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries , I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars
yes   are you ? , I've got my money and my keys   so I'm ready
well   it's started raining since then  Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! , well   I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then   as well
that's a good idea  But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it , ok  I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on  It's a bit chilly in here
maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse , I don't think we have anything to worry about  Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
alright  I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you , Do you have any more questions ?
Good-bye   sir , Hi   Jack ! How are you doing ?

I believe we met at a concert last year  I'm Taylor , Oh   yes  I remember
Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me   and I'm tired away  Second   you stood me up on the Valentine's Day , I'm very sorry for that   but I sent you several messages to explain   my mom was seriously ill   and I had to look afer her
You've got so many cousins  I called you later that night  But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone , I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time
No   don't   I don't want to see you anymore  Don't ever call me again , Hi   Jack   we are having a party tonight   wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend   Tina
No   I like being single  I never thought lonely   I'm focus on my career  Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success , Why is that ?
I need to go to the bank , But they are closed today
Oh   it's the first of April   April fool's day , You forgot all about it   didn't you ?
Tomorrow is my wife's birthday , Better not forget that   so kill you if you don't get her something
Your watch is ten minutes slow  So it's should be nine sharp  I'm gonna be late again  What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty , Don't cry over spilled milk   Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
You will be fine in the couple of month   just be patient  I've got to woke now   I'll be late , You only care about your work
OK   I'll leave at 9:15   Is that all right ? , Yes
Jim  I heard you got a promotion ! , Yeah   I ’ m going to be running the Walker Avenue Branch

Yes   sir  What time would you like   sir ? , I'm not sure  Perhaps around 8 PM

Goodbye   and have a nice day , How are you   Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days

Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? , Sure  I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies   not new pets !

I was really glad to hear about your award  Congratulations ! , Thanks   Denise  Actually   I was really surprised  I mean   there were a lot of qualified people out there
You look really wiped out , I had meetings back to back all morning  Then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the Six Soap presentation   and the phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office
Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever ! , When did you finish ?
Hello Mary  I haven ’ t seen you for ages  Are you still seeing Paul ? , No  We broke up last month  I ’ m taking a break from dating for a while

Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party , Thanks   Frank  I ’ d love to come  When is it ?
How are you wedding plans going ? , Very well  We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done  The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress
You ’ re getting married in three weeks  So that should be ok  So   you ’ Ve prepared the church   catering   transport   hotel-everything , Yes  We ’ Ve taken care of all of that  We decided not to get married in a church though  Neither of us is very religious
Oh   yes  It ’ s and excellent hotel  A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect   though very expensive , Yes  It will be expensive   but we think it will be worth it  It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people
As you know   china has a single-child policy  Therefore   there ’ s just my husband   my daughter and I  What about in your family ? , I have one daughter and one son  Then there ’ s my husband and I  What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ?
No   I have two older brothers and one younger sister  What about you ? , I also grew up in a big family  I have one older brother and three younger sisters
I ‘ Ve been married for about five years  What do you think about divorce ? , It ’ s becoming more and more common  However   I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ?
( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind   but don ’ t tell my husband , Of course not !
I ’ d like to   but there ’ s her boyfriend  He ’ s very broad-shouldered , He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that
We have different tastes  I like girls with short hair  I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself , Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ?
I'm getting a bit plump myself  Perhaps I ’ ll go with you , Who is Cindy ’ s husband ?
They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law , Do they have any grandchildren ?
Yes   she gets along with them quite well , Do they have a large family ?
He's 21  How old is James ? , He's a year older than Keith   but he looks younger
He can spend more time with his grandchildren , Oh   I don't think he wants to  He wants to travel to several different countries around the world
In the same way   probably , What's the life expectancy in your country ?
I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age   because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly , Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday
Oh   he's fine  Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays , He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ? , Yes   there is  Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives  They want to go out   have fun   and explore the world  They want to develop their own view of lifeParents usually try to discour
I had a big argument with david yesterday  I hope he ’ s not still mad at me , what did you argue about ?
yes   but is got angry with him too quickly  He probably thought that I mistrusted him  I shouldn ’ t have got angry , did you lend him a lot of money ?
no   we didn ’ t  I guess you ’ re right  We should patch things up , of course you should  You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship   would you ?
I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest  Honesty is very important to me , I think it ’ s important to most people  The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them
oh   I don ’ t  they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously  You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious , sometimes it can be hard to tell   but if you know the person fairly well   you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking
When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill   what do you do to attract his attention ? , I just make eye contact with him and nod my head  Then I tell him when he comes over to the table  Why do you ask ?
That ’ s what I thought  I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it  Anyway   what did you do yesterday evening ? , Well   it was a warm evening   so I stretched my legs  I walked along the canal for a couple of miles  Actually   several other people had the same idea  I saw Bill
I need to move some furniture  Could you help me to lift it ? , Of course  What do you want to move first ?
No   not very much  He's too ambitious and dishonest , I agree  I like his brother Paul  They are not alike
I think I'm polite   careful   relaxed and shy , Oh   I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party
So   you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? , Of course !
If everyone turned up   it would be a squeeze  But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go  So I think it should be OK ? , Are you taking anything ?
Helen gets on very well with her neighbors  I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too , I ’ m really looking forward to it  This party is going to be a blast !
it certainly was a great party  It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here , I expected that something might get broken  That doesn ’ t bother me  That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain   will it ?
afterwards   we can do the washing up together  Everything will be finished within an hour  Your friend Keith is really funny  I liked his magic tricks , yes   he ’ s very good  isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too
what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great   but was quite strong , that ’ s my little secret  Did you like the snacks and I prepared ?
all cleaned up  Are you ready to start on the washing up , so   tell me about your new house  How is it different to your old one ?
yes  One bedroom is for my wife and i  there ’ s another for our daughter  My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room   but I ’ d like to make it into a study  Our daughter is also keen on , what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook
yes   they are  That ’ s very important to us  We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light  Each room has large windows , do you have a balcony ?
it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood  There ’ s some traffic   but not much  It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre   but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or yo , so   your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday  What have you bought her as a wedding gift  I find is so hard to choose the right gift
most of the things were household appliance  You know   everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker  I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help , so   what did you get them ?
she says that after several years of use   it ’ s not working properly  When she uses it   it makes a funny noise , household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays
Not really  I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available   but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it  Sometimes   I ’ ll look at something in a shop   but lat , No  I ’ m a little worried about security  You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords  Aren ’ t you worry about that ?
I do  I ’ m a big fan of using new technology   but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day  I think people need to get out and interact with other people , So   how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet
Ok  I ’ Ve finished online  Let ’ s go  I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card , Thanks for reminding me  I had forgotten to get mine

It's a difficult choiceThe train is a little faster   but much more expensive , We could face delays if we travel by bus   thanks to traffic jams
Really ? I think you see more traveling by train , So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
The trains aren't usually fullWe can get them on the day we travelWe should buy return tickets   because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles , We should take a packed lunch on the journeyThe food they sell on the trains is always expensive

There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see  Want to go with me ? , I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her

George   is your chicken OK ? , It tastes great   but it is really dry  Is your fish all right ?

Let's leave 10 %   so that we at least leave something for the service , I agree  We will leave $ 360 for the tip

I think it will take about four hours   including breaks , that ’ s fine  Are there signposts along the way   in case we get lost ?
Yes   I agree  We can see the scenery better  In a bus   all you see are the roads , Even in Taiwan   I always liked to take the train  It is more comfortable
Beautiful , Do you think I can take a picture through this window ?
I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London   so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway , that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam  It could take three hours
ok  You haven ’ t seen my company car   have you ? , no  let me take a look  it ’ s longer than my car
we can ’ t  if we went that fast   we would break the speed limit , So   what do you plan to do today ?

Yes   of courseThe pool is open until 10:00 p  m  So you still have about 45 minutes , Good
I hope the food here is good , Yes   it is very expensive  Maybe we shouldn't have come here
Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ? , I thought it was O  K  But it really was too hotAnd I think they should show people more  The exhibits should be more interesting

The Queen Street   I guess , So is it the right way to the City Hall ?
No   that's not trueThe White House is very big  And there are a lot of historical exhibits thereThe tour will take us through many different rooms  I read about it in the guide , Hmm  If that's true   then the security there must be very goodBecause it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House
Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun , Yes   it's true I don't
No  But if you say something like that in the White House   they may take it seriously  Sometimes I think you joke too much , I'll be careful  Don't worry  I don't want to get arrested by the FBIBut how long does the White House tour last ?

Following the rules of world business   the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery   while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival , Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ?
Yes  The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival   and if any discrepancy is found   the claim must be raised within one month , I see  How do they make testing and analysis of this item ?
A seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct , I've been working hard for a whole year  I really need a break
When are you going to take your vacation ? , Later this month  I can't wait !
Thank you for your compliment  I bought this PC with my first-month salary  I am getting to know the on-line trade , I'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet
Yes   very gorgeous  Sometimes   I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house , What advantages does it have ?
The most important is that it is very convenient  You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time  Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers , So cool   if we do business through other ways   it will cost a lot of time
Of course   such as Alabama   which is a famous website , Thank you  Maybe I will do business through internet in the future

Can you tell me the concept of e-commerce ? Now   many people mentioned the word   ' e-commerce '   in front of me , E-commerce   or Electronic Commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the Internet

We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position  We are a good   small company---that's why you are interested , Then   what would make you feel more comfortable ?
How long will it take to make five hundred ? , They'll be done before the end of the week
I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection , I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents
To be frank   a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import  When I open a letter of credit with a bank   I have to pay a deposit  That will tie up my money and add to my cost , Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum

You haven't lost any weight   have you ? , No   doctor  I've actually put on two pounds
You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure , What examinations ?
Well done   Fred  Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? , OK   Let me see  I suppose we must strengthen our promotion   because our brand is still new to some consumers  Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously   because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places  Besides   the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products
Mr  Chen   I have a Marry from realty world on line one , I don't have time to talk to her now

It is my honor to have this chance for this interview  Well   my major is commercial English  You know   and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business   but also learn some theories on this field  Besides   during my college learning period   I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned , What is your greatest weakness ?
Well   I lost my grandpa when I was only ten  I often recall the period when he fed me , Well done ! Another question ! When will you start work   if you are hired ?

Considering our good relationship and our future business   we give you four percent  That's the best we can do  We can't go any further  What would you say to it ? , Then I'll accept it with thanks
Don't worry  I will find someone to assist you , That's all right  What can I do ?
The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept  Jerry and Tom will help you at that time  Any questions ? , Who will pay for these things ?
Our benefits usually include medical insurance   public accumulation fund and allowances , What are the allowances ?
As a new-comer   you usually have five days of annual vacation  And remember you have to fill out a request form   if you want to ask for leave , Will our company have some recreational activities ?
I see  Thank you  Sir   what kind of duties will I do ? , B   your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them  Is that difficult ?
I will leave a memo for you   sir , Can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ?
I see  And the quantities , 200 rolls of each  Make it 200 rolls for each sample
Six weeks   did you say ? , Yes   five to six weeks
That's the best we can do just now   I'm afraid , Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
Yes   I'll see that you get those delivery  Shipping by ' S  S  American ' as usual   is that all right ? , That's right
All right , These goods can be broken very easily   so we would be thankful if you would be sure to use durable packing materials
We always do that   but I will make a point to check it for you since it is so important , Do you always put a quality mark on each container ? For this shipment it is crucial to us that you do
What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? , Cartons  Is that okay ?
In that case   I guess I can rest assured , Well   I guess you can say that  The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to  Especially for those fragile commodities   we've got to be extra careful  Otherwise   if the things we don't want to see happened   we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience   too
It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case   would it ? Let's still use cartons , Sure   no problem  As I said   cartons are good enough for goods like this  You don't have to worry about it
I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow , So sorry to hear that  What's wrong with you ?
Yes   I did this in the morning  And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days , That's good  Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ?
Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms , I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents
But on our part   our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports  And there is the licensing problem , I understand that  Still   I'm not in a position to help you  Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together
Then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ? , By the middle of October
Thanks  Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ? , Let me see  Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it  Well   we can manage it on 20th September  That's the best we can do
Let me see your form  You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year   right ? , Yes   I need to go home to have a family reunion
Well   I understand that  Your request is approved  Remember to give my best regards to your parents , Well   we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment
But we have only moderate mean at hand  If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment   we'd really appreciate it , Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before   but we could consider your request  I'll phone our company to see what they say
What do you think about the equipment in our company ? , We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible
Good idea  A network of work stations is helpful for our management , And   to be frank   our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function
I was nervous at that time  What about you ? , Just fine  I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully  I found some answering skills are useful  These questions are different from exams
Sounds like a good idea  And I think this can leave deep impression to HR  How can we write a suitable letter ? , Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company  And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you
Of course  Let me check it  Firstly   don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it , That's right
And then prepare what you want to receive  If you want to send a photograph   you must copy one , What can I do next ?
Maybe we should call its after-service man , How much tea are you going to order ?
We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 , I'm sorry   but June 30 is quite soon  I can't guarantee 1 500 cases   I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1 000 cases and the next 2 000 cases
Right , Well   if there's nothing else   I think we've settled everything
Actually not so good  That's why we made a special trip to see you , OK   let me hear it  I'd be glad to help if I can
I would like to explain to you our financial position  The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money  It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced   and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts , But for an enterprise of your size   an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially
Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? , Yes  But the sum is large   it must be provided by a group of banks
I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports , It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight
A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports  You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due , Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank  You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible
How many do you intend to order for our shirts ? , What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ?
Yes   of course  We have enough productivity  You can rest assured , And for such a big quantity   you should give us a discount
We like your product   and are interested in placing an order with you as soon as possible , Well   we can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays  Our factories will be closed for another week
Thanks  We need the products in less than one month   because we have a big deal with another company  By the way   will payment against delivery be OK ? , That will be fine  And I can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order
Well   actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals   but since this one is so new I will listen to what you have to say , We want to make this a trial order  If we can sell all the products in two months   we will pay for them ; if not   we will send them back to you
OK   I agree  But the repeat order can't have the same terms , You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
Great idea , Well   I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me
To start with   may I ask why you chose to work at our company ? , First   you have had an impressive growth record   ever since the company had been founded for half a century  Second   I can improve myself by working here
Of course  A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company  Any extended illness will be covered by insurance  Have you read the other terms of the contract ? , Yes   I have read  In the contract   I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours  Is that right ?
Good  Now   you sign here   you can start work the beginning of next month , Steven   have a rest  Could you have a talk with me ?
When do you want me to come ? , Let me think  About half past seven if it is okay for you
Sure   what's the matter ? , As you know   I have accepted three new programs in our company this year   but I am not sure I can do my work well  And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs
Well   sir   I am busy in market development  So I am worried whether I can do this , I am aware you have been working so hard  Before hiring more employees   you are still needed to do this
Nice to meet you  My name is Tyler Smith  Let's go to your office desk   follow me please , OK
If you have any further questions   just ask me , OK  Thank you very much

Thank you , My pal   you are so nervous recently  You don't need to be like that
I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation  I was terrified to wake up after hearing that , That is merely a dream  Remember   there is always room for us to have further improvement  I think we did the good job in the whole period
Of course  I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans  And since I was employed   I have been working on them  Madam   how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? , How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ?
Thanks for your praise   Madam , Stephen   can you work overtime tonight ?
Must we finish our task before the holiday ? , Yes  The contract must be kept
He said he would celebrate his girlfriend's birthday , Don't worry  I will tell him about that
OK   I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan  To start with   generally speaking   the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours  This segment of the industry is well developed , Sorry to interrupt   Doris   but can you tell me more about these tour groups   what kind of things they enjoy   and so on ?
Just a moment  I'll tell you about that in a minute  Where was I ? Oh yes  By way of illustration   let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years  If you look at page ten you can see what I mean  In spite of these characteristics of the market   I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector , So how do you intend to do that ?
Go ahead , How much is it going to cost   and who is going to pay ?
Well   our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines  We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go   like the gym and student organizations  We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town , Hello   Pineapple Computer Company  This is Janice Shaw   the secretary of Nova  May I ask who is calling ?

How long would I wait ? , We'll give you our decision in 7 days
OK   good-bye , Janice   I can't find the document I was working on last month  Can you help me to look for it ?
I couldn't find the files you request   even though I checked all the cross-references  I don't think it's there , I am sure that document was filed
Maybe that's why I couldn't find it  All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' , Hello   my name is Clark  May I speak to Mr  Allen   please ?
We have thought of you very carefully   but the other candidate has more experience , Experience is indeed very important   but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ?
That ’ s a good idea , Good morning   Mr  Zhang   this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company
I see , We really believe that you are a highly qualified person  But the other candidate has several years of related experiences
Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? , I am afraid we are sticking to our choice

Exactly my understanding , A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company  Any extended illness will be covered by insurance  Have you read the other terms of the contract ?

Here I raise a question for you  Just imagine we will have a foreign guest from Japan  Can you tell me how I ought to be to the most comfortable and polite ? , Firstly   we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes  And then on the day when he is coming   we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate
And then   what should we do next when you meet the guests ? , Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break   meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know
I suppose we can bring him to visit our company   as well as our display room  In this way   he can know more about our company and our potential power  In my opinion   visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much , En   you are right   and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon  But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret  On one hand   show his our best side ; on the other hand   do not show too much to protect our own business secrets

My working hours aren ’ t fixed   sometimes I do the day shift   sometimes the night shift  In all   about 8 hours , That ’ s rather hard
My wage depends on production results , What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ?
There is the company union   but it really shares the same aims as the management , So you must consider dearly before you go to work

I will set it up , They will stay for two days  Try to work out an efficient schedule
First   about the terms of payment  Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A  This is not our practice  We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America , Good  I will add this to the contract
As far as the contract stipulations are concerned   there is nothing more  Thank you very much , Well   we have agreed on all the major points
Do you have some points to bring up ? , Well   everything we've discussed seems to be here
It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others  It's complete  So would you like to sign the contract right now ? , We've settled price   order   payment   now I am calling to ask about package  How can we pack the goods ?
Yes  As you know   that's the common practice for exporting computer  This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation , I see  Why not use wooden cases ?
Perhaps  That will be more complicated   if we use wooden boxes , Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers
Good morning  What can I do for you ? , Good morning  Would you like to tell me something about the computer ? I've never seen this brand before  What is your superior brand ?
With pleasure  It's easy to have a memory expansion on board capacity and fulfill your needs for a computer  Besides   there is more space for extra cards to expand later on , What's the memory capacity of the computer ?

Working under pressure is exciting and challenging  I don ’ t mind working under pressure  I work well under that circumstance  People can   I can , Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?

Hi   Bob   this is John Lin , Hello   John
I'm afraid I've a complaint to make   which is about the goods we ordered last week , What is it ?
Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau  According to the report   the damage was caused by poor packing  Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases , Our goods are well-examined before shipment  I'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route
Any questions ? , When will I know your decision ?
Thank you for your interest in our company , OK  Thank you very much
Have you done any work in this field ? What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? , I have learned a lot about business know-how and basic office skills  In addition   I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues
Do you feel that you have received a good general training ? , Yes   I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university  I am currently studying Finance at a training school
What are you greatest strength ? , Honest   hardworking and responsible
Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? , I know something about it  Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills
Definitely ! , If that information is exact   I guess our company is willing to promote someone
Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? , I think I am extroverted
That's right   even though I did set the alarm last night , Your clock never works  Perhaps you should buy a new one
Yes   I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years  And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years , So   I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market  If you give us the agency   that will be more substantial for our cooperation
Sounds reasonable  I will tell my boss about you agent application  Another question   what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? , To be on the safe side   and for garment of all materials   sizes   and styles   I think the amount will be 50 000 pieces a year
You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products  Through our continuous effort   consumers tend to accept your product  So   there will be a potential market for your product in this area   and would you let us act as your agent ? , We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city  But according to our record   your annual turnover is not too big   so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency
I'm afraid that's too much for us , We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us  However   our company has the regulation for the agency
You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries  At the beginning of our campaign   there is sales resistance to overcome   we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs  A 20 % commission will not leave us much , Our price is worked out according to the costing  A 20 % commission means an increase in our price  So   I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent
No  I'm still working on it , How much time do you need ?
Yes   sir  Most of us had positive review in last quarter  Take Fred and David for examples  Both of them try their best to achieve the best  Their progress is distinct   especially in last quarter , They are popular in and out of our department  Fred is easygoing   while David is cautious in working
John   you have done a good job  Our new series computer is appreciated by the guests  They intend to sign contracts with our company  You really did a good job , Thank you  I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users
Why not ? You've done so well for the company  She should give you a prize , I feel nervous when I face her  She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time
But the sale number is close to the predicted amount , I'm still nervous  I don't know what to say to the manager  I always feel ill at ease in that kind of place
Oh   no ! How did this happen  Are you sure ? , I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office  We got some complaints from consumers yesterday  I am terribly sorry for that
What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now , But we still have to find one  Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ?
Excuse me   I want to know the price of your CPU , Glad to tell you  The price of CPU is 300 dollars
Well   can you explain it to me ? , The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1 000 Units
In that case   we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made  Please reconsider , It is so hard to deal with
Nice to meet you   sir  I come from New Times Clothes Company  We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous  Would you please quote the price ? , Before we discuss the price   may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
That is to say   10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets , In that case   our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200   and the other is US $ 300 per set
What are your terms of payment ? , Letter of credit at sight
Well   I got all the point  All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor , OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade  We believe that through our cooperation   large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion
I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected , You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years  The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where
I agree that yours are of the top , Well   since your order is large enough   can you give me a rough idea ?
Right  A reduction of 5 % is acceptable , Well   let's have your firm order
In fact   if it weren't for our good relations   we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price , I can't agree with you  We have quotation from other sources too  Their prices are lower than yours
We have settled the question of price   quality and quantity  Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment  What are your terms of payment ? , Well  We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C   payable against shipping documents
What about the cost of delivery ? , We would like to do it in accordance with an F  O  B
Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ? , They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now  Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem  Please wait a moment

May I have your name card ? I am always concerned about the newest computer , Of course   here you are
OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ? , This is the latest design for our products  The design of I-series keeps the fashion in a close way  The sales volume of the new product is about 50 000 per month  And we received many orders from many clothes companies  New functions and attractive outlook are the key points for our products
I'll put the call through then , Thank you

Sue   this is Tom Lin from Allied Trust and I'm calling to offer you a position with our firm , What position ?
It starts at $ 30 000  S , I'm sorry but my bottom figure is $ 36 000
That's not as complicated as you suppose , Is it so easy ? I never experienced this  Can you tell me something about it ?
Correct  And our country follows the priority of use principle , Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ?
I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work , Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ?
I just read this in the whole afternoon  Let me show you , So coincidental  Actually we can exchange some information on this problem
Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency   which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent  This task is usually taken by the Patent Agent Department , How long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your Patent Law ?
Well   under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products   for example   machine tools for export  Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise   the other   an overseas firm  Most probably   the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment   and sometimes   parts and components   while the Chinese enterprises factory building   labor and other resources to the cooperative production  They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract , I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts   particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China
Yes   you are right  Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly   but they can enter into an agreement  In such case   each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible , May I speak to Marry ?
Ok   thank you , OK ! Let's get down to business now
That's right  And in my opinion   to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task , I know that  I need to discuss this with Arden  And in his opinion   we should widen the scope of our ads   so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign
I think the idea is very good  In the promotion campaign   two or more media are used together   so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent , What kind of media do you recommend ?
I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products  Meanwhile   ads are also the representation of the company's image , You ’ Ve been a sales manager for three years  How do you like the job ?
No   I don ’ t mind at all  I receive 3 000 RIB a month   after tax , Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ?
My expectation is in the 3800 to 4500 RIB range  That ’ s the take-home pay , Let's get down to business
I'm glad to hear that  We are trying to give you a favourable one , What's your price ?
How about 130 yuan ? , I offer you 110 yuan
If you order more than 10 000 pieces   we can accept 115 yuan for each one , Well   I'll accept the price and place an order for 10 000 pieces
I always approach things very enthusiastically  When I begin something   I don ’ t like to leave it half-done  I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished , What makes you angry ?
Pretty good  The HR manager asked me the usual questions  Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job , What did you say ?
Yes  I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession  But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only , That ’ s sex discrimination  When will you get the reply ?
Thank you , Mrs  Phoebe   let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods
What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? , We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days
Possibly   subject to quality and delivery guarantees , Of course  Well   in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months
Well   let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract , What are your personal weaknesses ?
I don ’ t try to lead people  I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody   and get the job done by working together , Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?

Are you sure that's high enough ? , That's a good point  I'll make a note to increase it to 480 to make sure we can accept the new containers
What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage  We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget , The cement arrived late but don't worry   I'm confident we can still meet the deadline  The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again

Quality is very important to us  We work to very low tolerance levels  We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials  Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers , Do you have many different suppliers ?
We haven't had any problems so far  They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service  We've called them in three times this month  They always arrive within a couple of hours , That's good service  Do we have to pay extra for that ?
Well   there are lots of things to consider  Quality and delivery times are as important as price  We also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service  We look for companies with a good track record  We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well   we put them on our approved list  It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with , What do you do ?
It depends on the time of year  At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch  We also contract out certain services all year round   for example   cleaning  We run a very tight operation ! , Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?

In spite of this   international business contracts and arrangement must be precise   specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding   misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 , Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved  For this very reason   it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise  The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations  Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive

That's why I came to your office today  We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable   because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 , That's true  But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product   you'll agree that 679 is not high   especially when we allow you a 10 % discount

You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking  Speech is a reflection of personality   you know  You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice   loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering , I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer

That's true  I got the news yesterday , You did a good job for the company  You deserve it
Not bad  I'm confident  And I like challenges , I believe you are cut out for this position  You're an outstanding individual
Good morning  What time is it now ? , It's just nine o'clock
Yes   quite often , You must leave home earlier today

4 % is too low   I think  You see   we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion   such as advertising on radio or TV   printing booklets   leaflets   catalogues and so on  It all costs money   4 % is not enough , Don't worry  We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase

The price seems acceptable for me  But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ? , Of course we can  We can provide the quantity you ask for
Excuse me  My name is Richard Davis of Magic Office Supplies  I'm here to see MrChen , Yes  He's waiting for you in his office  This way   please
Pretty well   I think , I think these patterns are quite good  Can you give me a price indication of these ?
Here is our price list   our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery   if you can pay it within one month  we'll give you a discount of 10 % , Very good  How many goods do you have ?
The most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen , I've just visited your showroom  You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets  I like them very much
Yes  It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality  You certainly have an eye for good things , Thank you for saying that  But what's the unit price ?
No problem , That's fine  Then let's sign a contract
Well   what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? , When we say your prices are much too high   we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent  If we are to place an order with you  I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient
How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight   our profit margin is not that large , Ok  I can settle for that
Your price is higher than I expected  Could you give us a little discount ? , This is already our best price
Could you make it $ 4500 ? , I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price  This is the best price we can quote
Let's close the deal at $ 4800   OK ? , You drive a hard bargain ! OK   that's a deal
That's much higher than I expected  Can you come down a bit ? , But if you placed a larger order   we would increase the discount to 10 %
That would be nice  Let's call it a deal , We're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators  But   there's one problem
$ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer , I'm afraid I can't agree with you there  Your price is much higher than other companies
Sorry   I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem   let me talk to our general manager first , All right   we'll wait for your answer
What's the advantage ? Price   I suppose , No   this type cleans better   no crevices between the body and handle joint
You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments   do you ? , We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances  But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines
Well   I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet  So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you , All right   but I'm busy  How long will it be before you can finish the talk ?
Thank you , If I remember correctly   time of delivery is another point in which we differ
Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year   does it ? , No  But in the United States   the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25
They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in , If that's the case   there's nothing to be done about it
By the middle of October  This is the best we can do , All right  I'll take your words at that
Hello ! Is Mr  Green there ? , Speaking  May I ask whom I am talking to ?
Thank you for visiting our products  I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so   could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? , I'd like to   but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week
Any time you say is OK , All right   expecting you
In fact   in the past we only attended local exhibitions , No wonder
To get around your difficulty   Mr Smith  I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half  You can send in an additional order later , Well   I'll consider the possibility  By the way   when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June
Getting the goods ready   making out the documents and booking the shipping space   all this takes time you know  You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month , Very well   Mr Zhang  I'll not reduce my order  I'll take the full quantity you offer  And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home
You can rest assured of that , Is there anything that you are interested in ?
When is the product going to be on the market ? , It will be released next month
Well   it's sounding good ! I'm looking forward to that , I think we have everything in the contract  Shall we sign it ?
I hope so  too  But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us , All right  I agree with you  But where do we hold arbitration ?
Ok , What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ?
Yes  They usually do it , Do they charge for that ?
They do the work without charge to the importer , It's part of their service   isn't it ?
No   you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment , I see  By the way   how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
You are welcome , Thomas   could you do me a favor ?
Why don't you go ? , I'm supposed to do it   but the general manager called me last night  He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled   so he asked me to attend the meeting for him
What certificates of technical qualification have you got ? , I have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate

I guess first I should prepare a resume   right ? , Sure  You should include your name   address and phone number in your resume
I got it  Then I should mention my educating background and working experience   should I ? , Yes  And don't forget to list them by date  Besides   you should begin with the most recent and then move backward

In what business are you most interested in this organization ? , In particular   I'm interested in marketing in the domestic field

That must have been stressful , Yes   but I learned a lot
What does Human Resources Department do ? , Hiring   firing   training   insurances   benefits   retirement plans   salary   vacation

Generally speaking   job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements , How should I contact them ?

That ’ s no problem , Do you have any other questions ?
I see , Salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job
Yes  In fact   the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation  In the long period of cooperation   the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations   they trust each other well  If your university recommends you   you can be approved more easily , But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same  So I doubt its authority
It depends  If it has something special or useful   I suggest you send it out , Anything else ?
How about sick days ? , You get five paid sick days

My pleasure , What is the great trait in your personality ?
Yes   I like inventive jobs and I am capable and responsible , Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules
They are   keep the documents in chronological order   remove all the chips and pins   punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder , And what is the most important point ?

It doesn't matter  Just do your best to sell yourself , DM210 is equivalent to 400 RIB
I will give you a definite answer on the price terms two days later , Peter   I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener
People here desire medium-priced air freshener only  Please carefully consider my proposal   which will lead to a larger business between us , The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go
Yes  I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you , Can I help you   sir ?
May I try this on ? , Yes  Let me help you
It's about the same  I've been thinking of making a change myself  Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? , No   not at all  Go ahead

Sure  So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply , Firstly   your answer should go straight to the point   and be clear and brief

Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend   not a boss , Oh   I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff
No   it's unnecessary  Just respect the staff and their own opinions , But sometimes they offer some useless proposals   it's awfully useless
We have the equal partnership in team , Thanks very much and you're very eloquent
Thanks   Jane  I was really surprised  I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there , Sure   but the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !

Yeah  actually   we haven't hung out at all recently  You seem sort of under the weather  Is there something going on ? , Well   keep this under your hat   but I think I'm going to quit after New Year
One of the best in the company , That's kind of you to say  But  the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all
GoodNow what kind of job do you want ? MrWilson ? , I don't mind reallyPerhaps a job in a shop or a factory
GoodNow here's the address of the factoryThe manager's name is , No   Dave  I haven't wrecked my jeep  I'm calling to offer you a job
I'm not interested   Zina , Don't play hard to get  The pay is good  You'd be working with Elvin again
Hey   Ken  I need to talk to you , Sure  what's up ?
Ok  I'm just going to lay it all out on the table   What do you think of Vincent's management style ? , Well   Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and  well  um
As I see it   he lacks the proper vision  His style is more about survival   and he's not taking the company anywhereHe ' s treading water instead of swimming , Well   I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before  It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings
Yes and no  We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired   but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting , Interesting idea  You might be on to something
He couldn't have told you  Only a few people at WebTracker know about me , The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours  He said everybody at WebTracker used them
OK   let's find somebody then , Good  I'll take care of it
Yeah  Let me see if he'll do it   and I'll get back to you , OK  Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin
Guess again   Dave  I have no intention of leaving invoking  Never did , What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh   no  No !
I saw your green post-it notes  Nobody else has them , Do you want to know what really motivates Vince to be nice to me ?
You wouldn't do that  Would you ? , I might  Vince knows he needs to keep me happy
You do ? How are you going to contact him ? , I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen
Can I spy on you guys from the window ? , No  But I'll fill you in later  Right now I have to find Vince
I had an idea , Look   before we get into the secret admirer thing   I want to talk to you about WebTracker
My mind is made up , My accounts go where I go  Vince knows that
I know   I know  Kill   or die   right ? , Right  The faint of heart should not apply
Hi   Zina  Lots of people are looking for you , Like who ?
You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? , What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ?
That would be WebTracker  We're heard they're almost ready  That's why we have to finish first , Or they'll take over the market before we even get started
Who has been here already this morning ? , Well   Vince dropped off some sales reports for youSaid you signed a big deal with HomeSuppliescom
Who else has been here ? , Elvin stopped by to see me
I can't do that   Zina  You know I can't , Bull  I're done my research  I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options
I guess I'm just a little nervous  I'm giving everything I have to invoking   and , and what if it doesn't work out   right ?
How ? , Because I won't let it fail
Look   we need to have the Starscom account   right ? , Yes  If we get it   we'll really be set for success

Thank you for saying so  I don ’ t know   probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them  I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues , Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances  People may think you are telling them how to do their work  If they take it personally   they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work

Oh   that will be great  Thank you so much  Please help me to double-check the name list  I have to make sure they are all correct , Ok   shall I make a coffee first ?
I had a bad start of the day  I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting , Indeed   I agree that is not a good start  How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ?
Err   kind of  You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days , Did you punch in ?

I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired  I think I am going to have some problems working with him , He seems to be quite qualified  If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves
Yes   it is a bold design  People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card  It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations , I agree  Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business  It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card   but it can make a big difference among the crowd  And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection  For they have outspoken colors   own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card  I wish to have one like this  But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow
Sure it is  This is a changing world  Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us , Yes   according to the agenda   there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course
What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand  You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong , What do you mean ?
Well   I prefer active rather than passive training  For example   I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin  They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice  All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room   so we could communicate with each other  We had a lot of fun learning together  It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues , Well   that is also very efficient   right ?
Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? , No   really ?
James is going to be packed off there , That is good  He can leave you alone this time
Well   actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday , Anything that distracts you from work ?
Well   I will try , How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ?
Well   I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry  Anyway   it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others   especially strangers , Sure   no matter what happened   they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way
Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so  If two employees get married   they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon   or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies  If they break up   the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable  By any means   the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating , But if two employees are in love   they will be happy  Happy people are more productive  If they develop an intimate relation with each other   they are willing to share knowledge and experience  It can help to improve work efficiency
We have a fairly good working relationship   but there was also a rough spot , What do you think his strengths are ?
Have you thought about it seriously ? , Yes   I have been thinking about it for quite a while  Now I finally make up my mind to leave  I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday
Good for you   but your leaving will be a great loss to us  It is so nice to work with you , Thanks  I had learned so much from you and our colleagues
What do you find annoying ? , Well   I work very long hours   ten hours a day is quite normal  And if something important comes up   I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening
Ok , I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM   is it convenient for you ?
Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? , What is the problem ?
Thank you very much  I am sure good rest will do indeed  I don ’ t have this too often , I would like to ask for one day off next week  Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company   but I do have some important things to handle
Yes   you should be there  Go find the manager and ask  I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off  Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form  It will be signed by the manager for approval , Thank you so much
Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one , If we were in the same conference room   I would not work late these days  That conference room has been booked out  This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company  So everything has to be rearranged and checked   like tables   chairs   mean tacks   podium   audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu
I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator , We need an operator now
Ha   I am flattered  Actually   when it comes to negotiate   you don ’ t need to like it  You just need to understand how it works , I am not good at it by any means  Give me some advice
Ok   as John after Kennedy put it   let us never negotiate out of fear   but let us never fear to negotiate , I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful  We just made a record sale this season
That is the best one I have seen  I am sure our target customers   young people will love it , Certainly
You ’ re welcome  You know   these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination  The more I think about it   the more I hate myself for being so disorganized  I decided to change the situation as soon as possible  Otherwise I will be more regretful later , This is encouraging news   good for you ! What is your solution   then ?
Hi   Monica   congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech  And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project  You really made a big contribution to our company , Thank you   I just tried my best  I am very happy to know you like it
Now   the effort pays off  You have accomplished something , Come on   don ’ t flatter me anymore  I took the job because I love being challenged  But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people

I'm sorry   I didn't hear you clearly  Could you repeat that please ? , Certainly  Mr  Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away  He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning  His schedule is very unpredictable at times   so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging

That's correct  If you remember   we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets  Now   when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals   there are three things to consider  First   the original condition of the market   second   our marketing numbers from the previous year   and third   our final sales figures for this year  Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts  If you look at the overhead   you'll see a graph  The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005   the red line is the sales in 2006  As you can see   our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with   but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year  On the other hand   you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket , Good morning   ladies and gentlemen   we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop  Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you  First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development   Harvard's own Dr  James Smith  Dr  Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years   and has taught at Harvard since 1995  And now   without further adieu   we'd like to welcome Mr  James Smith

How ? , You need to free your disk space  The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use  Things should be fine next time you start  You also need to control what starts up  There is a program calls Start-up Delayer   It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts  For example   you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up

I hope I could get promoted some day  Tell me about your experience   ok ? , Well   just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough   you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective  Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging  They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal  You learn more from that actually  Sometimes   you need to fail to be successful
Marketing Manager ’ s Office  Can I help you ? , Mr  Smith   please

How much do you spend on development every year ? , About 3-4 % of the gross sales
If I placed an order now   how long would it be before I got delivery ? , It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want
I jumped the gun , There were some gaps in your report  Please be more sorrow
It ’ s a great pleasure to meet you   Mr  Brown  I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom  May I know what particular items you ’ re interested in ? , I ’ m interested in your hardware  I ’ Ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues  I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada  Here is a list of my requirements   for which I ’ d like to have your lowest quotations   C  I  F  Vancouver
Here are our F  O  B  price lists  All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation , What about the commission ? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports  It ’ s the general practice
That ’ s something we can discuss later , How do I submit an expense report ?
Yes   here is the form for an expense report  Fill it out and give it to me  I ’ ll get it signed for you , Good morning   Miss Monica  Nice to meet you again !

Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season , Here you are  Do you need glue ?
With tomorrow being Labor Day and all   I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early  What do you say ? , What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone   not just laboring staff  and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway   so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ?
In our company   the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers  We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early , I call this meeting to order  Thank you all in attendance today   I know it's a busy day for you all  We have a lot of material to cover today  Did everyone get an agenda ?
I propose we accept the minutes , Good  Do I have a second ?
I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week  We've had the review board going over everything   and they have come up with a final review  Here's a copy for everyone   and if you have any questions   you can talk to me after the meeting  Basically   the budget review has been completed   with maybe a few polishing details left , What kind of action is required ?
Go ahead   please , How long is my paid vacation every year ?
We will provide you wit life insurance   health insurance   accident insurance   housing benefits   heating allowance and transportation allowance , How often is the bonus ?
We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad , Well   I don ’ t have any other questions so far  I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer
You ’ re welcome , Give these sales figures a look  It's pretty depressing  We're way in the red this year  We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer
Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller , It's really too early to tell   but a lot is riding on the new products  If we don't do better after the product launch   we may have to go bankrupt
My goodness   I didn't realize it was that bad , What's our target audience for this campaign ?
Well   there are some similarities that come up  Because both groups are made up of mothers  so as before   we can play up on maternal instincts   hygiene   safety   along those lines  But that being said   there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here , Right   that makes sense  What's the average age ?
Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities   as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year  All together   there will be 15 events , What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is
We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment   then a rally for cancer research   and a connection to the inner-city education program , Sports   medicine   education  seems kind of random   don't you think ?
Let's see  You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China  They should be able to place your order before the end of next week  It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo  The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean   and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today  Domestic shipping will be your responsibility   you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles , Fine  We will handle domestic shipping   but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control
It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address  I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already haveWe ' Ve reached the awareness level   but we haven't established customer loyalty  People know who we are   but they still don't trust in our brand , I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time  Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important
What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? , Understanding comes from product differentiationWe get that through product demonstration   literature   expert testimonials   and the like
Why is the price so high ? , It's not just that the price is high   it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly
Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out   the price of this model will become more affordable , But by then   the technology will be outdated
This model has advanced technoledge   superior components   it is compact   and it's a top-quality product , I guess you get what you pay for
That ’ s ok  I should have told you earlier  This is a company rule , Do we also need to punch out after work ?
From eleven thirty to 1 o ’ clock , May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
Yes   that is me  Nice to meet you   Monica  Welcome on board ! , Thank you  I am very happy to have my own office now  I ’ Ve never had one before  It is very nice

Is Mr  Thomas there   please ? , Sorry   I can ’ t hear you  Could you please speak up a little ?
Mr  Thomas is making a long-distance call  Please wait for a few minutes , Would you like some coffee or tea ?
I like it black , Coffee will be right with you
Not really   I ’ m in a meeting  Can I call you back in  say  15 minutes ? , Sure   speak to you later  It isn ’ t urgent  Maybe it is easier if I send you an e-mail
Unfortunately   he has left for the day , I hate to trouble of you  But it is urgent  Please leave this message into him

Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? , Yes   and I check all the e-mails for Mr  Thomas
Yes   I'll be promoted to department manager , I'm glad to hear that  Congratulations !
Thank you very much , Right   that ends the third and final part of our presentation  I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points  I'll give you a brief summary  There are three potential areas for development in the future   domestic   overseas market   and the internet  Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy  for domestic   we can rely on past research   for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants   and for the internet   we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers  Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success  Mark   did you have anything to add ?
You ’ re welcome  For the moment   I have no further questions  I got a good picture of the job and the company  All my questions have been answered  Thank you for your time , We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not
What are in this folder ? , They are reports of our company
Can you find last month ’ s report for me   please ? , No problem   here you are
I think you are looking at the wrong line  The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products  You are correct   the hair product sales decreased slightly   but not dramatically  The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products  I think there was a problem in the marketing plan  Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products   but it was already too late to mitigate the damage   so our mistake shows up in the sales , Well   the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off  Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks
Hi   I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow  A technician has just come and checked it  He will bring me a new one tomorrow  It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing  Can I use the one in your office ? , Of course you can  I am sure this one works very well  I just sent dozens of pages  How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
I can ’ t make out anything   the words are too light  I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month , It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax
Check with somebody from the IT department  They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment , I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine
Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail   you print it out , Would you please mail these letters   Lucy ?
All right   who should I send them to ? , It ’ s sent to Mr  Charles  I believe he is in London
Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? , Yes   it ’ s right
I didn ’ t pay attention to that  I will try to get the paper out , Be careful   the cartridge can be very hot
What are they ? , They are   keep the documents in chronological order   remove all the chips and pins   punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder
Hello   this is Francis , Hi   this is Monica  I was wondering when we can work on this financial report

See you , Lucy   I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor   it keeps flashing   which drives me crazy  Would you like to help me with the ladder ?
I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company , I see  If I got hurt when fixing the light   even during office hours   I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility

Good question  But I will tell you when you pass the first two , What ’ s up ?
Of course not   I appreciate that , Well   it has nothing to do with virus  The problem is your attachment is a bit larger  It has exceeded the e-mail capacity
The demographic reports are in  From the looks of it   we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues , Why   what's the lowdown ?
No kidding  We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups , Excuse me   could you please show me the way to the human resource department ?
Just a minute please  I ’ ll make a call to the HR office  Yes   they confirm your appointment  Please come in  it is on the 3rd floor   room 3106  You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today , Thank you very much

What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages agoWhy haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? , No   sir  The plant expansion project has been delayedThere was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permitsIt seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species

Last month   we only had 40 hits on our site  Our products and prices are good   but the problem is that no one knows about our website , If we want to get this internet business off the ground   we've got to do something fast
Yeah   you're right  We've got to get the most popular phrases there  How else can we boost site traffic ? , I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs  If they have related services   they may be willing to help us out
From the numbers   it seems like Forest Inc  is our digest competitor  Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market , Le'Ban is the new kid on the block   it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon  With them on the scene   the competition is outthrough
We're in a very competitive environment  It's sink or saimin this market , Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys  I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday  the competition never sleeps and neither should we
Yes   I want to know exactly where the money is going  Give me a detailed report , First we have the airline tickets   which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going   that's t $ 2 000  For our accommodations   we're spending $ 80 a night   per room   for five days  That's another $ 800
So far we have $ 2 800   what else ? , I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses  That totals another $ 800  And for other incidentals   like take fees   and tips   I have estimated about $ 400
How did your company's fundraiser go ? , The fundraiser events went really well  We were able to partner with a few of our competitors   all in fun of course   to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society  All of the people who participated it had a great time   and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research
Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society , In all honesty   it's also a great deal for our company  The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community  We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign   plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause
John   I have been watching you  I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed  You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts  I just want to let you to know   after this month's performance reviews   I'm recommending you for promotion , Gosh sir   thank you   sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department
You've earned it , What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ?
It's hard to say   because the branches are located in diversity different countries   cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets , For example ?

Yeah   why   is there something going on Thursday ? , A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob   he's been with the office for ages   so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement
Wow  I thought he was early forty stops   why would he want to retire so soon ? , Well   I think you prepare it well and capture good savings   retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities   you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't   don't you think ?
Lower level employees need not attend  The purpose of this retreat is for training   especially for our management team  We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level  In order to get everyone to jell together   we've got to include some fun  That's the reason for the retreat , Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you
Yes   that ’ s right  I do speak decent Japanese , Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market  We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities  We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started  What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion
So if I can help you as a consultant   what is in for me ? , We could give you an uncite office   as well as potential to develop your own contracts in JapanAt the same time   after helping with our project   we will be willing to split our profit with you
What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage , You're right   it's a low percentage  Also   in order to attend meetings   you have to hold a certain amount of shares  It's quite a large number   so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings
Please send this memo out to all the managerial staff  there will be training for all the department heads next week  Attendance for managerial staff is mandatory   except for the financial department  Financial officers may participate if their schedules allow , You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry   sir   could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ?
No   they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers   but they do not directly supervise others  They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training , So tell me   what's the difference between the Board of Directors   the CEO   and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me
Usually not more than 15   not less than 10  They meet monthly   quarterly   or biannually to oversee an organization or company  They provide long term planing and vision   and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line , Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents  I checked in his office   but he is not there  Is he out of the office now ?
He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives  He can continue working   taking a few of classes here and there   and in 2 years he will complete his MBA , Sounds like a tiring scheduleHe ’ s probably got a lot of homework too   eh ?
He just has his secretary do his homework for him , Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?
Not necessarily  I think people would be impressed by your language abilities  It says something about your level of intellect and experience  Also   I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume , It's just a piece of paper   you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?
Well   that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure , Could you tell me something about it ?
Four  They are production department   finance department   sales and marketing department and HR department  I directly report to Mr  White  He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning  Probably you will be meeting him at lunch , Ok  Who should I report to ?
Well   your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts  You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports , And I represent ?
You ’ re welcome  Feel free to ask me any time you need help , Hello Mr  Jones   please have a seat  Thank you for coming in today  I have read your resume  You completed University in England ?
I have ten years marketing experience  This includes both entry level and management positions  In my last position   I worked my way up to being director of the marking department , I can see that from your resumeYour last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company   is that right ? Later   why did you decide to leave your former post ?
I would rather work full-time , I'll make note of that  Now   what are your salary expectations ?
It is 15 minutes ’ drive , What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
Yes   our company has two floors   the 6th and 7th floor in this building , It ’ s such a large firm  Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
Yeah   what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already  Don't tell me there's more bad news , Well   I'm afraid there is  I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests  there won't be any results
Oh   no   you can't be serious  I never expect anything like this would happened  What are we going to do ? , There's nothing that can be done  Everything is gone  I wish I could tell you differently   but what has happened has happened  We will just have to figure out a way to move on
No   I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements  Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? , We can do that   but it will cost  If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime   you're looking at an increased cost of   I'd say   maybe 10 %
Hello ? Ms  Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling  I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month  As I said in my email   we can help you with production according to your needs   but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis , Oh   yes  I reviewed your estimate  But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind  Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ?
Hold on   let me pull up your version 7 requirements  Oh yes   no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind  I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12  That will definitely add to your cost on this project , How can I help you ?
Yes   he knows I'm coming  Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock , I wonder if Mr  Smith forgot your meeting  I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm  Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place  Will you please have a seat ?
That would be very nice  Thank you , Right this way   Mr  Mason  We can start with our front office  When Ms  Terry is ready   you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor  There is a conference room already prepared
You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones , You know what we will get ?
This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk  The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments   like fax   copier   a screen   printer and scanner   and it will be very convenient , Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment   I don ’ t need a desktop anymore  A laptop is enough
Yes   I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now  It took me almost one minute to open it  Then there is no response to any click , I have the same question  I can ’ t send out mails  We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately
Well   I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother  Anyway   I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave , Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy   limiting the personal use of internet   I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that
Well   keep a low profile , What ’ s up ?
Of course not   I appreciate that , Well   it has nothing to do with virus  The problem is your attachment is a bit larger  It has exceeded the e-mail capacity
Did you hear something ? , Oh   it is my cell phone ringing  I set it in the vibration mode
Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done , Good idea
Well   but for this one   don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings   I think it is not reasonable  What if there are some important calls ? , Well   this one is not compulsory  It is just suggestion
So you have to open all the envelopes , Yes   except the personal mail  And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly
What are in this folder ? , They are reports of our company
Can you find last month ’ s report for me   please ? , No problem   here you are
Well   just something in general   like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals , Sounds practical ! To be honest   sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career  I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker  I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills
You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting  What ’ s up ? , Well   I just came in  I worked overtime yesterday  Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate  So I stayed to double check them  The boss was aware of my very late work of last night  So before he left office   he told me I could come one hour later this morning
That ’ s normal after a tense work evening  Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either  Once   I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend  That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later , Working at weekend is something I hate to do most
Well   I ’ ll be glad to help you out  We can deliver what you need to your office , Shall we need at 1 fifteen this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit
Welcome to ABC Company  We have been expecting you   please have a seat  I will call him , Thank you
Yes   please  Please print your name and company name   and the person you are going to see , I am Liu Yi   from China XYZ Company  I ’ d like to see Mr  Thomas   please
Mr  Thomas is quite busy   I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today , Would you please ask when he will be free ?
I came two years ago after I graduated from college  This is my first job , You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college
It is so encouraging to hear this remark  The secret is to make plans  Write down your goals   short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month  Then just work hard , Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ?
You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law  They should be aware of their rights , But these people say nothing about that  They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days
You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit  You worked so hard , You are right  For the past few weeks   I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well  What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday  It is time for me to take a vacation
Totally agree  What is your solution ? , Well   there are two causes of job stress  One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition  So if we want to manage job stress   both we and the companies should do something  For me   I am trying to balance work and leisure time  You know   all work and no play make Jack a dull boy
But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition  Anyway   we are not the bosses , I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them   like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities  Our boss is a smart person  He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team
Yes   as the New Year is coming   they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers , Well   I guess you will meet many people in this field  So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase
No   no one has informed me of that so far   tell me , Ok   there is no cash advance anymore for short trips  You have to pay out of your own pocket   so save all the receipts from your business trip  And then attach them to your expense account  When you get back   our company will reimburse everything
I will call them this afternoon   thanks , You ’ re welcome  Have a nice trip
Thank you  I am very happy to have my own office now  I ’ Ve never had one before  It is very nice , Well   we have nicer things than that in this company  You will find out soon
That is very kind of you  Thank you very much , Hi   Francis   how was your business trip ?
Actually   the business trip itself was very successful  We arrived on time   we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year , Sounds quite fruitful   why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
I am still waiting for their call , Take it easy   all sufferings have their reward
I guess they must not have your contact information   so they sent it addressed in care of your department head  Anyhow   they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract , Can I see it for a second ?
Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? , Let ’ s see   ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting  ” It looks like  hey   was there anything else sent along with this letter ?
Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter  You should give them another call , I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues  For all of you   we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department  She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this
Monica   wait a moment  I think we ’ d better call the repairman to do it , I think I can handle it by myself
Other company rules also need your attention , Like this one ?
Don ’ t mention it , Can you help me for a minute ?
You can just put Dear Sir or Madam   officialese not personal   you can write to whom may concerned , OK   So I first thanks them for their business   I can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support   How is that ?
Right   do you need them to respond ? , Yes   the letter would have a survey inside   and they should complete it and return to our office  How should I write that ?
Well   I love it  The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine  There are plants along the corridor  Especially   I got my own desk with computer and telephone  Such a great place ! , That ’ s very good  I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful
Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job  I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently , Totally agree  By the way   the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506  You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor
That ’ s ok  I should have told you earlier  This is a company rule , Do we also need to punch out after work ?
From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock , May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
Sure   company rules are not very strict at this point , Thank you for telling me that
Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters , I got it
We'd like to welcome everyone to the Michelson Tools factory site   and thank everyone for being here today  My name is Paul Shafer   I'll be showing you around today  Please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour   I'll be happy to answer questions for you , Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ?
It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant   and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory  All together our tour should last about half an hour , Okay
We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order   probably about two or three cases  The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock , You can double check with the housekeeping department   but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges  Last time when we made our order to the supplier   the quantity was also especially high  They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us  As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance   they can usually fill the order
OK   will do , Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters   I'm pretty sure they came in last night
What about that one ? , This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it  How can that be ?
I guess the fax machine is out of paper   too  Don't worry   I'll have someone look at it this afternoon   and in the meantime   I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine , May I help you ?
It should be under Leslie Smith  The number is 184796 A , Yes   Mr  Smith  I have an order for three cases of cartridges   it that what you would like to refill ?
No   PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane   Milton County   98830 , I will send you an invoice in the next few days  Your order should be delivered before the end of the day on Monday
Hello  I would like to speak to your director of human resources   MsJenkins   Please , Just a moment  I'll check to see if she is at her deskMay I tell her who is calling ?
No problem , I'm sorry   MsJenkins is away from her deskShe has already left for lunchWould you like to leave a message for her ?
I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are , It's okay  I've already had several days in a row working through lunch
I insist  I really appreciate you taking time to work with me in  What is your favorite fast food ? I'll cater to your taste , Actually I do like Chinese  Let's make it a date for Chop Suey and the Martin account at about twelve thirty  Does that sound good ?

What about the afternoon ? , At 2 PM   give a presentation here with the press  At four o ’ clock sharp   have dinner with Mr  Smith   manager of NCC
These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail  Others are ordinary letters , All right   who should I send them to ?
Office address   please  He might be at work when they arrive , Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
Of course you can  I am sure this one works very well  I just sent dozens of pages  How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? , Yes   I think you have the same model as I have  Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
Well   all right  There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents   information and other things , What are they ?
You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule , I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine
Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail   you print it out , I can ’ t make out anything   the words are too light  I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month
Check with somebody from the IT department  They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment , Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy  There are some figures I want to check
Do you mean all the sales letters from them ? , Yes   that ’ s right
No problem , Look   the printer isn ’ t functioning well  I ’ Ve pushed the start button  It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log  What ’ s going on ?
Be careful   the cartridge can be very hot , Mr  White   I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company  It will be effective at the beginning of the next month
Oh  If you had talked to me first   we would have given you a raise , You are really a good employer   Mr  White and I am very lucky to have such a good boss like you  But this new job is more in my field of interest training  It's something I have always wanted

Well   as you know   I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States  They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market  Naturally   your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately  I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant   luxurious   first class dining , Mmmm   sounds interesting  gourmet chocolates   where are they produced ?

Would you like to make another appointment ? , Unfortunately   I'm leaving here unexpectedly   and I may be away for several days
Hello ! , Is Petti there ?
I'm sure you have the wrong number  This one has been my number for more than 20 years , That's impossible  I remember the number clearly  Isn't this 763-4565 ?
That's all right  This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone , Yeah  I guess it does  Sorry again for bothering you
This is Jane   I'd like to speak to MrWang   please , I'm sorry   he is not here at the moment  He has gone to the International Business Center
Yes   thank you  When he gets back   please just let him know that jane called  And i need him to call me back , Does he have your number ?
Yes   thank you very much , You are welcome
I would like to take my two weeks vacation time , Seeing as next month is our slow season   that should not be a problem
I've read your report   and I'm not sure I agree with youYou think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? , That's right  I know it must sound crazy to you   but we believe there will be fewer absences this way
I see  So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work   resulting in more sick employees , That's right  If sick days were mandatory   sick people would stay home  We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics
What kind of benefits are we talking about ? , Our standard package includes health insurance   two weeks vacation and a company car
Vacation time is important to me  I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days , What an interesting idea   Ms  Wilson  Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ?
You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ? , That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it  Mr  Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place  I ’ m leaving today   and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday
No problem at all  To tell you the truth   I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork , From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this positionWhat I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job
Yes   I believe that it ’ s crucial for me to know if a company is right for me   not just if I ’ m right for the company  I ’ Ve only been impressed by what I ’ Ve read and heard and I see myself having , Commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here
Sure  Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off , I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them
No   you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses  However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities   you can take the attention , I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed
To be honest   I don ’ t plan in that much detail  My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand  I see myself advancing as I succeed   but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on , interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker   or do you depend more on your superior for direction ?
I see myself as an encourager  Of course   sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail  In my last job   each representative handled , So   your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper
I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999  Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? , Yes  I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada  As a manager   I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period
I can ’ t attend the meeting in Washington  I ’ Ve proposed you as the most able substitute , But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before !
Yes   but when you send in your expense report   you also have to file a report summarizing your trip  It ’ s not just a big vacation   you know , That sounds good  But what do you want me to do there ?
I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center , You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there  Would you like to make a reservation ?
That ’ s a good deal  Since this is a working trip   I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients , Yes   we have five meeting rooms   of various sizes  We can accommodate large meetings and small   informal gatherings as well  Of course   if you have many small meeting   you might consider checking
Looking through your C  V    I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University  Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? , Well   I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field  But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design  I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design
That ’ s impressive  How would you make that pay ? , Tie it in with the pay-per-view services   and perhaps it could be a money-maker
So   you ’ re just starting back  Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience , Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ?
No , Our sniffer dog seems to disagree  Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine  I mix it with hot water like tea  Sorry  I forgot about it , What are these red things sir ?
Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ? , I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years
Where do you see yourself five years from now ? , I see myself in a management position
Mmmm  I ’ m not sure if we have you down here  How do you spell your last name ? , It ’ s L-e-e
Oh no   we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine  It ’ s in lieu of a deposit  If everything is OK when you check out   we give it back to you then  It ’ s pretty sta , I see  I guess you can tell I don ’ t travel much
Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand , From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft  That ’ s overbooked
So who has to stay behind ? , Well   first we ask for volunteers  If someone like yourself volunteers   they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year  If no one volunteers we just have to select someone
I hope you enjoyed your stay , Definitely ! Very relaxing
That ’ s right   sir  Three nights at 500 dollars a night  that comes to $ 1 500 , But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive
I ’ m sorry sir  The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy  That means it ’ s 250 per person  The room itself is 500 dollars a night , Perhaps I could talk to your manager ?
I ’ d like to use my Master Card   if I could  Hey   wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected  Why is it so high ? , The bill is itemized   so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services  Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service
I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! , Those are for pay-per-view movies  Each time you selected a movie   the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it   right ?
Do you want the large size   or the small size ? , The large size please  Do Have you any writing-paper ?
A bottle of glue , And I want a large box of chalk   too
Is that all ? , That's all   thank you
Accounting   this is Mike , Mike   this is Leo in Sales  I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrowAre we still on ?
Right   see you then ! , Hey there ! I ’ Ve been hoping to run into you  Are you busy tomorrow morning ?
I can explain them to you  It ’ ll just take about a half an hour  How about Friday afternoon ? , Ooh  Sorry   that ’ s not good for me  I am tied up all day Friday  We ’ ll have to do it next week  I am wide open then
Good afternoon   Mr  Dome ’ s office , This is Denise   Mr  Bruce ’ s Secretary  I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr  Dome at 4 o ’ clock
Yes   that ’ s correct , Ok  Thank you
Great   thanks  I was calling to change our meeting next week , Ok   sure  When did you have in mind ?
That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm , Great  Talk to you then
Here you are  Do you need to see my passport ? , Any form of picture I  D  will do
Actually it wad taken just last year   but I had a shaved head and a beard  Can you still recognize me ? , Barely  Will you be checking any luggage today ?
Hi I came in on flight 513  Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt   but mine didn ’ t seem to be there , Let me check the computer  Uh-oh   Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris
You can reach me at 13661306917 , Thank you  I am terribly sorry about this  It very rarely happens  We do have a sophisticated tracking system   so I know we will find it soon  But we apologize for the inconvenience
I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal , I would like to buy a ticket to New York please
Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? , Yes I know   but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what
When would you like to return ? , My return date will be the 14th
OK Mr  Lee  I have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in New York on the 6th at 6 , Will there be any layovers ?
$ 800 dollars , Hi  I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delayHow long of a delay is expected ?
I think you should stay in the airport  Even though the delay is expected to be two hours   the flight departure could be announced any minute  Who knows ? , What seems to be the problem ?
Good morning  Please come into my office , Good morning  Thank you
Wonderful  I ’ d like to know why you ’ re interested in this position at our paper , Hi  I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled  Is that true ?
It ’ s possible  If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there , You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? !
Certainly  You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience , We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this
I don ’ t think he ’ s back today , Oh   that ’ s right  Go ahead anyways  I ’ ll fill him in  We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances !
She had a very impressive resume   but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs , What made you think that she wasn't very confident ?
When she first walked into the room to greet us   she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all  I thought that was a bit unprofessional , you're right  If she walked into meetings with our clients like that   it would make our company look bad   wouldn't it ?
On top fo all of that   she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space  she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting , That's true  I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then
Can ’ t complain  And you ? , Business is booming  I understand you want to meet up with me next week  How ’ s your schedule looking ?
Do you mind if I smoke here ? , Yes   I do  I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t  The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on
It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside , Though the AC has the air-purifying function  I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke  Are you okay with that ?
yes   but I have a few questions for you , Ok  Ask away
even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? , that ’ s correct
I see  I guess that makes sense , do you have any other questions ?
how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? , men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child
I guess so  I don ’ t have any other questions  Should I sign here then ? , yes   please
I've made a tough decision   sir  Here's my resignation , well   I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised  Is there any possible way to change your mind ?
oh   no  not at all , are you planning on studying abroad ?
Oh   no  I would never look for another job while working here  I think this is a fantastic place to work , well   what's the problem then ?
really ? I didn't know that would be possible , sure   we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you
let ’ s start with you  How was yours ? , it was really busy  I had to work straight through my lunch break
it was nice of your boss to give you an option  My boss would never do that , let ’ s get back to you  How was your day ?
I ’ m fine  But I have bad news , what ’ s that ?
well   I was late to work today  It was the third time I was late this week , how late were you ?
my boss is really picky about that  He never arrives late   usually works over-time   and always gets his work done on time , oh well  You never really liked your boss anyway   did you ?
Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? , Nope
Amelia   could you spare a few minutes ? , sure  What do you need ?
it's complicated  But basically it boils down to one thing  This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go , but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here !
the head office is in New York   but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time , it'll be sad to see you go   but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity
of course I can  In fact   if there are other job opportunities at this new company   I'll recommend you personally , thanks  I appreciate that
it's challenging   but I'm enjoying it quite a bit , that's great  I knew you'd do a good job as a manager
well   that's part of the problem  His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass , what seems to be the problem ?
to be honest   he has no authority  He's a hard-worker   but no one listens to him , I see  Not everyone is cut out to work in management
that's perfect  I'll let him know tomorrow  Thanks ! , hello ?
the reason I'm calling is because Ms  Collins will not be able to call you back until next week , oh  I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday
she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today  When are you free today ? , any time after 2 pm today would be good for me
I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon  She has an opening at 11:30 this morning  Will that work for you ? , that will be fine
I ’ m well  And you ? , fine  How ’ s your job going ?
I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs , how ’ s it going ?
our headoffice is here in Beijing   but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon , where will those be located ?
we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow , well   good luck  I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !
really well   thanks , how are you finding your new boss ?
she's far better than my old boss  He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down , how about your new co-workers ?
of course  I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well  They were like family to me , do people in different departments get along with each other ?
yes   it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives , do you like working in teams ?
I don't know  I only started looking for a job a few days ago , I see  Have you found anything that you're interested in ?
I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering , there's not a very high demand for that kind of job   is there ?
yes , by the way   I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in
that's interesting  Do you think they'd hire me ? , well   you have plenty of experience job hunting  I think you'd be the perfect person for the job !
I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! , don ’ t worry  I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake
that ’ s true   but my supervisor is very dishonest  There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth  I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault   and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha , let ’ s think realistically about what might happen  How much money do you have in your savings ?
that ’ s very generous of you  I guess that would work , if you lose your job   you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy  If you live frugally   you ’ ll save plenty of money
I ’ m all right   thanks  Just a little tired , Late night ?
Yes  My name ’ s Mark Benson  I just started a couple of weeks ago , Well   if there ’ s anything I can do for you   let me know
I'm colin  It's nice to meet you  What do you do ? , I'm a freelance English teacher  How about you ?
I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field , have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ?
yes  I'm pretty out-going and friendly , do you have experience in the IT field ?
yes   but not fluently , that's OK  Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ?
no   because I didn't know what I wanted to do , I think you need to update your CV  Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it
nothing special  how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? , everything has been fine for the past several months
sounds interesting  Where did you get the idea ? , as you know   table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners
yes  this must be a huge difference , can you think of anything else ?
and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly  we quietly like little mouthfuls , i got it  i'll bear it in mind
How's your job search going ? , I only started looking for a job a few days ago
that's good  Don't forget to design the format  An attractive format is as important as the content , absolutely   I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read
no   a CV is not enough  You should also attach it with a cover letter  Don't overlook it  You're faced with fierce competition in the job market  If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of , sounds reasonableEven if I'm the right one for the job   many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time   so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention
I just received a phone call for an interview next week , Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever
yeah   besides my personal introduction   what else should I prepare ? , you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can  It is important to show that you've done some research into the company  The interviewers Wil
are there any other things I should pay attention to ? , yeah   wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual  That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression
why ? , many say more development opportunities can be found there
well   that's true   but living expenses are also higher in big cities , I've considered that  I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent   and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person
sorry to hear that  It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home , sure have  I want to offer my parents a better life ; so   I'll have to work very hard
sure  What do you want ? , I want to tell you I've put in my notice
and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? , yeah   after receiving my yearly bouns   I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market  I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received
this way   you'll earn more at the new work place , that's right  I am not the only one who has done this  Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry
I had a really busy day  I had to work a little overtime  In the morning an important client called to place a large order  I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order , What kind of things did you need to check ?
I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer  Each time   I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings  Each client has different conditions and required , It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client
Yes   it was  I managed to sort out the problem   but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour , You certainly had a busy day
yes   I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college  I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not , yeah   feels like yesterday  Now I ’ m almost settled down here  We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot
no   I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival , why is that ?
that ’ s right  I work extremely hard   and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here   but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here , I understand your position  Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong  You ’ ll feel much better with your family around
Yes   well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone   but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify , Well feel free to ask me anything   and I ’ ll try to fill in the details
I understand  And are there other bonuses included ? , Well   apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers  But we could go through all the details of that at a later date
Well Rebecca   is there anything else you need to know for now ? , I don ’ t think so   Mr  Parsons  I think you have covered all the main points for me
Well   we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow   so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week  Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday  How does that so , That sounds perfect  Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr  Parsons
Absolutely  Thanks for coming Rebecca  Goodbye , Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example   how big is your workforce here ?
Well   as you know Rebecca   in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five  You could be on call at any time  We do have to work very unsociable hours at times , Well I am used to that   Mr  Parsons   so that ’ s not really a shock for me
Yesterday ! But no   we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month , That sounds ideal
So   what changed ? , Well slowly but surely I proved myself   and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer
I see   so why did you decide to leave finally ? , I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities  I really needed a more challenging role to be honest
Definitely   but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? , Well as I mentioned before   I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career  I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character  My father always taught me to be a high achiever so
Well   you know journalism is a highly competitive world   so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true  Okay   well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here   shall we ? , Yes   please
Yes   true   but how about other personal qualities ? , Well   I believe I ’ m a good team-player   but I can also work well independently  I ’ m very enthusiastic and   well I hope my colleagues would agree   I ’ m fun to work with
Now   if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? , Yes   that ’ s right  After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK  My major was English   and my minor was business studies  I completed my BA in 2004
Well   it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca  So how about extracurricular activities at University ? , Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing   so I became the editor for the University student magazine   which I really loved  Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter   to help the homeless in York
I ’ m sure  Okay   now let ’ s move on to your work experience   shall we ? , Yes   okay
Certainly  And after your internship ? , They seemed impressed   and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter  I ended up staying two years there actually  I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper  I really
The London Weekly right , Yes   in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future
thanks  Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal   but not boring to look at , it looks good to me  I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page  The bosses seem to like that
I ’ ll take that suggestion too  How about the content ? , I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things  You might want to make the conclusion a little longer  Restate your reasons clearly
thanks for those ideas  I ’ ll get to work on them right away , we ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now   but take your time over this project  We don ’ t want to make any mistakes
from next week on   we should be in less of a rush , I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off  Everyone deserves it
carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work , good  I have to go right now  I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long
I will  Enjoy your meeting ! , hello  How was the marketing meeting ?
so did i  I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people , so what happened in the meeting ?
that ’ s good advice   but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted , may I make a suggestion ?
I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea , go on  Take a chance  You could just hint at your idea  The client should be smart enough to take a hint
So   do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? , No  if you do that   the workers won ’ t like their jobs  They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover  Those things will increase you costs
What else do you suggest ? , Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services  Price yourself near the low end  Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else   because many customers distrust very cheap things  Th
See Julie   the receptionist  She knows where all that stuff is kept  You might like a calendar for you desk  She can give you one of those too , Thanks  I need to make a few photocopies
Yes   I do  Everyone ’ s really friendly  Sometimes   I wish I worked outdoors more   especially during the summer , What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ?
I have a typical 9 to 5 job  Actually   I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days , Do you get paid onetime ?
We have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1  we can take coffee breaks during the day  My boss doesn ’ t mind   as long as we get out work done on time , My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks  I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork   doesn ’ t it ?
I work in a cubicle too   but I I don ’ t mind it , What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?
I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that  I don ’ t think we should use an agency   because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ  Have we decide on the location of , Yes  We have  We chose the location in the northeast of the city   not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD
Yes  We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries  We hope to sign another three this month , When will the branch office open ?
Yes   it has  We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines , I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy  We should be able to get plenty of customers
That ’ s right   although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do  The lunch break is flexible  You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer , That ’ s fine  Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ?
You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning  There are other meetings for people working together on certain projectsDepartment heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee , I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already  I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together
Ok  This is your cubicle  At first   you ’ ll be responsible to me  Later   you ’ ll be working more independently , That ’ s fine  I need to learn how you do things here first  Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account   aren ’ t they ?
Yes  Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon  Bring your portfolio with you , Certainly  Is there anything else you would like me to bring   Mr  O ’ Brian ?
That ’ s a big order   Jane  I am really swamped , I know what you ’ re saying   but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy
I can ’ t just now   Susan  Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? , Well   I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you   if that ’ s all right
Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? , Not at all   sir  I ’ d just like to push it up to next week  I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week
Nice to meet you  How can I help you ? , I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account
Yes   I do   Susan  Just a moment  Here it is , Thank you   sir  Sorry to trouble you
What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week , I know   but I want to make reservations this week
The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides  Do you know all about them ? , Yes   I pretty much understand the company
When you are choosing what to wear   keep all of that in mind  Have you chosen what to wear ? , I already have something to wear
You need to make sure you arrive on time   smile   be pleasant and friendly   look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability  You'll do great ! , I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview
When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed  Does that make sense ? , I think that their attitude is rather casual
You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it   but can we talk about other basics ? , Yes   where should we go from here ?
Yeah   hold on a second  I ’ Ve got it in my office  Here it is  553-2213 , 553-2213  Great   thanks
Happy to meet with you  Now   do you prefer group projects ? , I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group
Could you work for us in another state   if need be ? , I need to stay in the area because of my family
Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job  We ’ ll be getting back to you , Can you help me plan the office party ?

Hmm  I don't know how it could have happened , I remember   sir   that your friend took the billYou didn't pay for the lunch yourself   did you ?

I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after allIt looks like the back of the house was burning , I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this  Do you know them well ?
I think they went to Mexico   but I'm not sureIt ' s a bad thing to return home toThey ' ll come home from their trip   and they'll see half their house burned , Yes   but at least this way no one gets hurtIt ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home  Don't you think ?
It ’ s a programme about islam  It ’ s very interesting , Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?
Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life  Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith , When muslims pray   they face towards mecca

It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars  People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years  It seems they will never end
So   if the cause is poverty   there should be a programme to make the country richer  If the problem is resources   share them , It sounds easy when you say it like that  In reality   it ’ s harder to make peace between countries

Oh   it ’ s been uh  fifteen minutes , How does the political system work in your country ?
Almost all of them do  A few are independent  That means that they do not belong to a party  If one party more than half of the mp ’ s  they form a government  That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members , What ’ s a cabinet ?
Any mp can present a law to parliament  The proposed law is debated and voted on  If it is accepted   it becomes law , I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties
They produce manifesto  These documents which states their policies  Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election  Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters , What ’ s the matter   dear ?

I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past , I know  It really makes a mess of the whole election process

Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then , That is cheating and   if you get caught   you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment
I am pretty sure that I didn ’ t send that claim form in , You have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you
I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time   so I won ’ t be late , You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know   in advance   how much you will be working
I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment , I would be happy to answer any questions you might have
My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period , When you filled out your Continued Claim Form   did you show that income ?
I am not going to show any income from now on then , I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you  There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements
I can ’ t figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week ’ s , Did you generate any income during that time period ?
I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form , When you are able to find work and get paid   we always take away part of your check
Well   Mr  Brooks  I ’ m sorry   again   for the delay   but we should have everything completed by the time you get back , I certainly hope so  Can we arrange to meet on the 27th ? That should give you enough time
I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why , Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ?
Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ? , It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it
Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ? , Your check will be arriving late   but the next one will come right on time
Only 25 minutes or so  We ’ ll send somebody to meet you  That ’ s 11:30 a  m  Friday the 15th ? , That ’ s right  I ’ ll be in the baggage area
I understand  Would you like me to call you back ? , No – That ’ s all right  How about the 30th at 4:00 p  m  ? – Is an hour enough ?
All right  That ’ ll be fine  Can you put together a rough idea of the kind of money I ’ ll have available for the next year ? , Certainly  I ’ Ve already worked out a general budget for all the departments
Okay  The sooner the better , You bet  I ’ ll swing by after lunch   okay ?
Well   I would have preferred to do it today   but if you ’ Ve already made plans   we can do it tomorrow , I ’ d appreciate that   sir  How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ?
Fine  Let me take a look at his schedule  He ’ s free on Tuesday afternoon at 1:30  Could you come in then ? , Yes  That would be fine

We ’ re having a lot of trouble with our printer  Could you come and take a look at it sometime this afternoon ? , Let me see  Yeah   all right  I ’ ll be over about two
Tuesday morning is good for me  How about 10:30 in my office ? , Okay  Sounds good  See you then
That ’ s fine  I can make that , All right   then  I ’ ll see you at noon on Wednesday
He ’ d like to do it as soon as possible   sir  How about tomorrow at 2:45 ? , Mm   yeah   that ’ ll be great  Tell him I ’ ll see him then
Yes   she ’ ll be working closely with you on the marketing end of things , Good  Well   welcome aboard   Ms   Robbins
Oh   about seven years  Time flies   you know ! , Does it ever ! Well   let ’ s get started  If you could begin typing this letter now   I ’ ll see what else needs to be done
My fax machine ’ s on the blink  Would you take a look at it ? , Sure  I just need to do one other job first  How about if I come up around 11:30 ?
After a week   you ’ ll be running around here like a pro  Let me give you this list of departments first   next to each department is its location and the name of the manager , Great – That ’ ll be big help   Ms  Green
I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment , Absolutely  I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that  Let me just get my book
Certainly   Mr  Knight  When would you like to meet with him ? , Can you see what his schedule is like on Wednesday ?
I tell you what   800 is no good for me   but why don ’ t you guys get started and I ’ ll come by at around 8 , That ’ s fine with me  How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll , Sure   anytime
That ’ s out for me  I already have a standard meeting on Thursdays at 9:30 a  m  How about Wednesday afternoon at 2 , That ’ s all right for my department  I don ’ t know how the rest of you feel
It would be best if everybody could be there  How about next week sometime ? , Let me take a look at the schedule  I ’ ll get back to you this afternoon   all right ?
Well   let ’ s plan to get together next Monday afternoon   around three ? , All right   I ’ ll put you in my book
Yeah   why don ’ t you do that   and then you can give me a call sometime next week , Fine   Mr  Grant  Thanks for your time  I ’ ll talk to you next week
We ’ re starting at 12:00 and it ’ ll go on for the rest of the afternoon , I ’ ll try to make it  I should be able to fit some time in around 3 o ’ clock
Let ’ s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday  We ’ ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit , Fine  I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday
Fine   thanks  Mr  Emory would like to meet with Mr  Macmillan tomorrow afternoon  Can you take a look at his book ? , Sure   just a second  All right   what time ?
Sure  What ’ s it about ? , He wants to go over the bonuses for this year  He ’ ll need to meet with Mr  Winthrop and Ms  Montgomery  Can you set it up for me ?
I was thinking about this afternoon   after the sales meeting , Fine  At 3:30 ?
He needs to see the two of us to talk about next week ’ s annual sales meeting , I haven ’ t got two minutes at the moment  Can ’ t you go over things without me ?
That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke   you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! , I understand   Ms  Fairbanks
No   I ’ m sorry  I disagree  I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all , Well  I ’ m sorry you feel that way
Is the officer that pulled you over here today ? , He's here
The officer wouldn't lie about that , He must've   because the signal had a camera on top of it
I'm just going to let you go , I appreciate that
what happened to him ? , he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving
what happened to him then ? , not much ; it was a minor offence back then  He got away with a fine of $ 500
what do you think will happen to him ? , well   he'll definitely lose his license   pay a fine   and maybe even spend some time in jail
my sister is a lawyer  I can ask her if she can help him , that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help
Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ? , Well   you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry  Come on   Fred   We're wasting time
Is he at home ? , I'm afraid not  He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment
When was this break-in ? , I believe it happened last night
Was anything stolen ? , I haven't checked yet
We'll send a squad car shortly , I'd appreciate that
Really ? , Yes  I was right there
I can't believe it , I was really scared when he pulled the gun out
Did he get caught ? , They caught him before he could walk through the front door
What can I do for you ? , I ’ m going on trial
I ’ d be glad to help , How much do you charge ?
I don ’ t know what to tell you , Okay  You ’ re hired
I want to speak to you about this year ’ s election , Oh   really ?

We certainly do  May I ask you the purpose of the rental ? , I'd like to put some valuables inside   you know   documents and jewellery   things like that
You can choose a short-term or yearly rental , I'll have to ask my wife how long she'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings  I'll come back after we have discussed it  Thanks for your help
For what purpose exactly   if you don't mind me asking ? I must ask because I need to know the size   you see , No problem  My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house  Initially   on the advice of a friend   I stored it in the freezer
Certainly   just fill in this form   please , Good morning and welcome  How can I help you ?
I think I'll go for the smallest   as it's just for documents  Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time , You can have more than 1 key if you'd like   but we must have signature cards for each box
OK   I'll take a small   for 1 year   in this branch   please , First National Bank
I need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet , What's your name and account number ?
That's no problem  We have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you , You see   I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home
Yes   I see  There are just the two of you at the moment  Please take a look through this brochure ; it's especially for first-time-buyers  I think it'll be very helpful , That's great   exactly what I need to know  Thanks
I can deal with that   Sir  Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ? , The personal card   please  Is it possible to take care of this over the phone ?
You'll need to deposit 1 500 RIB initially  There will also be some small additional charges for this service , That's no problem  How long will the whole thing take ? A week ? 10 days ?

The minimum deposit is 1 500 RIB  But you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well , I think I can manage that  Let's see  yes   here we are
I'm here to help  Tell me your questions and I'll do my best to answer them , What if I require a loan for a short period of time ?
A wise decision  If you decide to take out a short-term loan with us   say for 6 months or less   the interest rate shall be for that of a 6 - month loan , What if I repay it early  Any perks ?
It's our pleasure  We are always happy to have another satisfied customer  Thanks for calling  Goodbye , Hello   Mr Mayhew  How are you today ?
That might be a good idea   yes , Your balance is 21 290 RIB  How much would you like to take out today ?
No   I don't think I have  But I would like to hear the full details   if you think it'll be beneficial to me , Good morning   and welcome to our bank  What can I do for you today ?
No   no problem  It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it , I see  Well   you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it  Which would you prefer ?
Yes , You see   that means when anything is up for renewal   we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out  All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you
Yes   I did indeed  But   could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ? , Of course  As we provide many different services for all of our valued customers   we like to give than a special place to do their business with us
Right  Is there anything else that can be done there ? , There's information on deposit or loan rates   exchange rates
So   I can talk to my Personal Banker 24/7  That's really thoughtful of you  And I have to say   I love the new look of the bank , Welcome to NO Bank  It's Mr Zu   isn't it ?
She's fine   thanks  Actually   she's the reason I'm here  It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special  She's been nagging me about our furniture   you see , Can I give you some advice on a loan   or
Yes   I know  But it can't be helped  It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house , Let me run through a couple of other options with you  That way   you can make a more informed decision
What can I help you with ? , I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools   you know   something other than stocks and such like  Do you have any ideas ?
Exactly  Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas   it doesn't have to be stocks  And   we provide a Professional Fund Manager   so you know your investment will be safe with us , How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ?
Right   let me run through your options  You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to   but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan , OK   what does that entail ?
Not at all   Mr Zu  As the certificate is due in 2 months   you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate , I'm glad you thought of this  I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest   right ?
Hello   and welcome to IBA  Which service do you require ? , Hello   Shelly   is it ? I'm here on behalf of my company   so I'll need the Corporate Banking Services
If it's this kind of consultancy service   I'll have to direct you to another department   I'm afraid , That's no problem  Do you offer any other consulting services ?
Consumer Credit Department  How may I help you ? , I need some info on car loans  Such as payment periods   interest rates   things like that   please
That's excellent  Well   for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates  The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years , I plan to repay it within 2 years  And the interest ?
We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis  And since you are already a valued customer   there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan , That's nice and easy  Thanks for your time
That's a problem facing many young families nowadays   and we are sympathetic to the problem  That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , Great   I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ?
Yes  When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan  As long as you provide the proper documentation   of course , What do you require ?
Hi   buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? , I usually put them into my bank account  I think that is a little secure   though the interest rate is low now
No  This is my first time to buy some  You can see that its historical price data is rising now , But that is a little risky   you know
I can ask for some advice from him , This is Lincoln Bank   Consumer Credit Department  How can I help you ?
Yes   I do  It's ready and waiting in my account , The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you   who are already contracted to us   so
Yes   it's 110 000 RIB  So   with the down payment done   I will need to borrow 70 000 RIB , What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form   ID card   proof of residency   proof of income   the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment
I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you , Are you an existing customer ?
When I opened the account with you   I was a student   I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary   so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead , That's very sensible of you  We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards   getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments
I'd like to apply for a credit card with you , Would that be our standard card   our gold card   or our platinum card ?
Why such a big difference ? , It's all about credit rating and salary  If your credit rating and your salary are high enough   we can offer you the platinum card
That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire , Welcome to Lincoln Bank  What can we do for you ?
Yes   of course  It's so much easier than cash   to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash  I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month , You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month
So   if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? , Yes  As long as you keep making regular monthly payments   paying the minimum is just fine  Of course   your credit limit will be lowered accordingly
Oh   I see  Well   I don't plan on only paying the minimum   but it's good to know that I can if I had to  Thanks for that , Welcome to Credit Services  How can I help you ?
Is there anything else ? , There's quite a long list   actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses   medical expenses   any internal payments
In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver , It's Mrs Bardot   isn't it ?
Hello Greg  Yes   that's correct  You see   we have just acquired a new partner   the transaction is huge  It's to be signed next month   and we would really like to have some clearer information about them , I see  So   it's not for your company   it's for the prospective partner ?
The lady at the desk   Shelly I think   told me you offer many other consultancy services , We do indeed  Such as making trade investments   financial consultancy   and of course the service you requested
I need to do a credit investigation on another company   but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult , How so ?
Really ? I have been told   by another bank   that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China , 10 years ago   maybe yes  But nowadays we are a global village   it's easy to deal with any foreign country
I'll return at about 4:30 pm  See you then , Welcome to IBA  What can we assist you with today ?
That does sound good  I'm already an account holder   have been for many years  And I already have your existing card , That should make things perfectly simple   then  Actually   if you had waited a little while longer   we would have notified you by post
Certainly , OK   so you are already a gold card holder   with a sound credit history  That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card
I think so , We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company   the company address
Check   check and check , What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ?
No problem   I'll settle that now  You can take it from my Business Account , Good morning   Sir  Can I help you with something ?
Yes   please  But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first   right ? , That's right  But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure
Yes   here you go  And sign here ? , Yes   please  That's being processed now  As soon as the account is set up   we can issue you with a card
Hello  I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card , Sorry   I'm not quite sure if I understand  In what way   Sir ? Has your card been stolen ?
Yes   my application was accepted last Friday  Now it's Wednesday   that's more than 5 days , Sorry   Sir   but it's 5 working days  This does not include weekends   so your card should be with you later this week
Nothing   thanks  I again apologise for the misunderstanding   bye for now , Hello   this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank  May I speak to Mr Was   please ?
Sending it won't be necessary  I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon , What perfect timing !
I'm sure it'll be fine  How about my PIN number ? , That will be sent on to you within 2 working days  Then   you can start using your new card
I want to take out some money   but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter , Unfortunately   an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money  That's what's causing the hold up
I did that already   while I was waiting  Also   here's my card , Thank you  And you require
OK , Thank you  Here's your card back and your money  Please double check it for me
This is Mr Meng speaking   Michelle , Oh   hello ! Sorry about that  I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ
Shall I come in and collect it ? , Or we can send it to you  But if you would like to use it at the ATM   you'll need to wait for your PIN number
I see  Yes   that's fine  I'll be there at around 2:30 pm  See you later   and thanks , Good morning  Madam  What can I do for you today ?
I received my new card this morning   but I'm unable to use it , Oh ? You mean   the ATM machine has eaten it ?
Yes  I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away  So   what's gone wrong ? , Did you receive your PIN number yet   Madam ? You see   unless you have your new PIN number   to match your new card   you cannot use it  We usually send that separately   around one day after the card   for security reasons
I'd like to pay some money in using my card   please , No problem  Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ?
I'll look forward to that   I can't stand queuing , I know what you mean  How much would you like to deposit with us today ?
OK   done  When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal   I mean just registered , It will show in your account straight away  Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ?
I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card  Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? , Well   welcome to our country  I trust you are having a pleasant stay ?
Fine  Here you go , How much would you like to withdraw ?
OK   200 USD   please , Here's your money   your card and your passport  Please double check the amount for me
I hope you can give me some advice  I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills  It's such a long way from my home   but I checked and you are my nearest branch  Is there anyway I can do it from home ? , That's terrible  Unfortunately   we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town  What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service
But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean   I receive my bills   not you , We set up an agreement with the   say   phone company  They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account  Of course   we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies
I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter   but I need some advice on mortgages   can you help me ? , Unfortunately   no   I can't  But our specialist can  Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you
A black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated   thanks , I'm the Mortgage Advisor at this branch  You wanted a chat about housing loans ?
It's 600 000 RIB  But I've already put down 200 000 RIB   which is my absolute limit   so I'm looking for a loan of 400 000 RIB , So   you've already made a large initial deposit ? That is good news  OK   let's have a look at your credit details and get this started
Welcome to IBA  Do you need any assistance ? , Yes   please  I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates
We offer many different payment plans  Would you be looking at long-term or short-term ? Are you looking at a 10 - year repayment plan ? , Definitely  I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can
I'll get our Mortgage Adviser for you  Please take a seat   I won't be a minute , May I help you at all ?
I see  What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible , This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items
That is good to know  Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease  Thank you , Good day ! What can we do for you ?
That's great  I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum   though , With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan   the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price
The funds are all ready to go in my personal account   so let's transfer it , Personal Loans   how may I help ?
Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? , Not exactly  Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad   for example   you   or your direct relative or spouse
Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely  That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back  Thanks very much , Welcome to Lincoln Bank  What can we do for you today ?
Yes   yes  It's all here  There you go  I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan   do I ? , You do   I'm afraid  There are 3 ways to do this  You can choose   mortgage   pledge or guarantee mode
OK   that's perfect   70 % is excellent   it'll be a big help  Thanks , Did you need help with something ?
How can you help me ? , I work here
Here it is , All right   here is your ballot card
All right  Thanks for your help , Are you planning on voting ?
Really ? , Yes   and I have no idea how to do it
That ’ s okay  They describe everything on the ballot , I didn ’ t know that
Congratulations on your first voting day , Are you going to vote ?
Is that right ? , I don ’ t know how to vote
They tell you everything on the ballot , They do ?
You should be excited about your first vote , Will you be voting this year ?
Are you serious ? , I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing
The ballot gives you all that information , Nobody told me that before
Good luck on your first election , I am really excited !
This was your first time voting   wasn ’ t it ? , I just turned 18 last month
You turned 18 a month before the election , I didn ’ t think of it that way
Congratulations on being a part of history , Did you vote yesterday ?
I voted for Obama , I ’ m shocked he actually won
He was the best candidate this year , What about him being black ?
I am so excited ! , Excited about what ?
Yes   I just had my 18th birthday this year , That ’ s lucky
I didn ’ t think about it like that , Really ?
Can you tell that I ’ m excited ? , What are you excited about ?
I just turned 18 a month ago , You ’ re lucky
I didn ’ t even think of that , You didn ’ t ?
Did you vote ? , Of course !
I didn ’ t expect him to win , I had no doubt in my mind that he would win
I thought his race would have kept him from winning , Times are changing
National Trust , My name is Alice Lin   and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet
Union Bank  How can I be of service ? , I need to know how much money is in my account
You voted   right ? , You know I did
Can you believe that he actually won ? , I knew he would win
I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American , That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf
Hello   there  You are looking a little confused ; can I help you with something ? , Well   I've always used the Bank Book   but now I have this card  I don't know how to use it in the machine
Yes   this one is in service  Put your card in here   in this slot and wait a moment  Then you will see some instructions on the screen , Oh   it wants me to put in my PIN number  OK   I can do that
That's the beauty of these machines   you can do almost anything  And unlike a person   they don't usually take breaks or go off sick ! , I hope you can help  I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM
I see  calm down   don't worry  May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ? , Yes  I was only entering my PIN  I'm terrible at remembering it   I'm so forgetful   you see
Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure  If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts   the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen  Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you , Oh   I see  So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
Good morning   Madam  Is everything OK ? Is there something I can assist you with ? , Thank you   yes  I'm not sure how to use this ATM   I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book  But today   I thought I'd try something new  I want to take some money out
Just look at the screen here  It'll give you prompts   you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number   then press ' enter ' to confirm it , Then it'll give me my money ?
Yes   then enter the amount you want , Oh   as simple as that ! I shall never wait for a real person again   these machines are wonderful

Welcome to Lincoln Bank  Which service do you require today ? , I'm here to ask about a loan
I see  What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans , Could you tell me what the requirements are for that   please ?
That's great  We'll also need details of your occupation , I have all of that with me  I've also banked here for a number of years
I see  As you don't have a long history with us   we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you , Yes   that's fine  My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years
We always welcome new business  If you can give me the details of your former bank   including your account number we can begin , I have everything right here  I'll let you go through that and come back  I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice
Before I verify those   I need you to fill in some forms  Then   as I said   I need to see valid credentials   your occupation and income details , OK   as I expected  How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean   I don't need a massive sum of money
We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly , How soon before this goes through ?
Good afternoon  What can I do for you today   Madam ? , It's a little sensitive   actually  I need to get hold of some money   and quickly
I understand completely  There are other options   such as a Personal Pledge Loan , I've not heard of that   could you tell me more   please ?
Of course   we'll need some documentation from you  Like your resident permit   proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate   to use as collateral , And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient
Your credit is fine   Sir  Now   tell me   what is it that you need the loan for ? , I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations  You know   a bit of decorating   some new furniture   nothing flashy

The initial amount is just 2 000 RIB   but we can go up to 100 000 RIB  But remember   it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral , OK  I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you  Thanks for your help  Bye
Hi   I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates  Could you give me some advice ? , Not a problem  Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry   I must ask   because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for

Right   I see  It all sounds pretty complicated to me  I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do , After you've thought it over   get back to me and we can go ahead
So   if I do decide to go ahead   how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? , First of all   you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us  This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account
I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal  I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account   you see  I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit , Unfortunately   if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date   you must give notice
Oh dear  Well   if it has to be done   then it has to be done , Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ?

Hello again  What can I do for you today ? , Yes   I'm back ! It's nice to see you again  I'm here about those documents
Well   we were contacted by your manager and he said , Yes   we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee
Good morning   Mr Bell  How are you today ? Are you here to sort out your L / C documents ? , Yes  I've been through them and there's a problem   a rather major discrepancy actually  You see ? It should be KN509
Yes   I see what you mean  You need to reject these documents , Welcome to IBA  How can I help you ?
Yes   it sure is  The L / C number is JD185649000023 , JD185649000023 ? Yes   found it  175 000 Euros   is that correct ? JD185649000023 ?
That's fine   thanks , Good morning   Sir  Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program ?
Do I get a card ? , Yes   you can have a Money Link card  You can also base the account on time deposits  The choice is yours
That sounds better  Also   can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say   if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? , Yes   you can have multi-accounts on the card   you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits
I received some leaflets in the post from you   one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies  Is that right ? , Yes   that's right  We have just introduced the program   but it's very popular already
What if I don't want to come in to the branch   can I use the consultation service over the phone ? , Certainly   Sir  Via phone or Internet   any time   any place
I see  What is it exactly that you are interested in ? , I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit
That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK   if you were to buy this insurance policy   your yearly fixed income from it would be 9435 RIB , And for the Savings Deposit ?
Good day  Welcome to IBA   what can I assist you with today ? , Hello   yes   I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you  Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you
Yes   that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program , What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on  I mean   some days I buy and sell quite a lot  Some days   there's no activity at all
Hello   Madam  What can we do for you today ? , Hi  I've been sent over from Turner Interiors  They said I need to collect some sort of L / C ? Do you have it ?

No   not at all  I was just calling to tell you that everything has been checked and double checked   and there is no problem with the documents you brought in this morning , That is good news
Welcome to the International Business Department  How can I help you ? , Hello  I'm Ms Dawson from Lexington Software  I need to send these documents to Vietnam via L / C

Hello   this is Quinn from IBA , Ah   hello Quinn  Oh dear   you are calling to tell me there is a problem   aren't you ?
Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake , What do you recommend we do ?
Hello   Mr Lawson  It's a pleasure to see you again  You seem to be in here all the time at the moment ! What can I do for you today ? , I've prepared some L / C documents   all in accordance with the conditions  There shouldn't be any problems ; I've done about a million of these things recently
Good morning   Felix Wasserman Associates  Beth Jennings speaking , This is James Hong calling from Lincoln Bank
That's great ! That was quick   after it not being there yesterday I wasn't expecting to hear from you for a while , Well   it's here now  Shall we credit that straight to your account ?
I certainly am  What can I do for you ? , I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about a loan I want to make
Excuse me   will you change me some money   please ? , Of course
500 dollars   please , Please wait for a moment  Now here is your Chinese currency  See if it's right  It's 3 220 yuan  Please keep this exchange memo  You may need it for converting when you leave China
What can I do for you ? , Well   I'd like some legal advice  Jane and I are thinking of incorporating  So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation
OK , I will give a call
Excuse my troubling you  You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings  Are they still in good condition now ? , Yeah   exactly ! I bought them last year  En  at present   they are still in good state
That's great ! Thanks for your support  If any   please remember to call us  I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye   Mr  James ! , Bye !
Yes  Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange , What kinds of currency do you change ?
The buying rate is 826  44 yuan for 100 dollars , I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here
What else   Ma'am ? , No   thanks  My husband said   We'd like to pay now
Oh   it's a service charge , But I only have 900 in cash here  Can you let it go for 900 yuan ?
Yes , Great  Here it is
It'll be great to have you again , Thank you very much
Okay   here are the forms  Can I use traveler's checks to open the account ? , Certainly  Just make them out to National Bank   and sign and date them
Yes   I want to deposit 1000 Yuan in my bank account , Please fill out this deposit form   first
Yes   I do  Here it is   and the cash , Wait a moment   please
Yes  Can you tell me what the interest rate is now ? , The deposit rate is 08 % every month
Yes  I want to make a remittance to New Delhi , Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ?
Hello   I want to remit one thousand Yuan to Magnolia Company , Please fill out this form   please
OK   I see  Here you are  Is that OK now ? , Let me check  Yes  Your one thousand remittance   please
OK   when will this remittance arrive ? , Generally it will arrive within a week
Thanks   I will , Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ?
We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day  As new orders keep coming in   they are working three shifts to step up production  I'm sorry   but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill , Well   in that case   there is nothing more to be said  What's your last word as to the date then ?
Good  Let's call it a deal  We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September  The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled  But of course you cannot count on that  In any case   we'll let you know by email , That's very considerate of you  And now   shall we discuss the insurance terms ?
Quite right  According to the usual practice in international trade   special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them , Then what about SICC ( Strikes   Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ?
All right   I'll adjust the price accordingly , Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ?
Yes   our delivery fee could be waived   if you make an order of 50 units or more  We would have to insist on the annual contract   however  I understand it's not the most convenient for you  Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate , That would be fine  We could accept a lower rebate
It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms  They reached us two weeks ago   and were immediately examined after they arrived  To our astonishment   about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms  We can't accept them in this state  They are unfit for human consumption  And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them , Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind  Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years  We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten  Have you any evidence ?
The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags   sixty of these bags to a carton  It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact  So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing , As you know   before shipment   the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question  They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export
We've already got in touch with the underwriter  But they have refused to accept any liability  They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage , That's a matter over which we could exercise no control   then  I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement   that is   if you have covered this risk in your coverage
Well   live and learn  It seems we'll have to waive the claim , Good Morning   sir  What can I do for you ?
I am not sure  What's the rate today ? , It's 1 Australian dollar to 61 Yuan RIB
Oh   the rate goes down , It does   sir  Do you still want to have it changed now ?
Well   I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB , Okay  Please sign here in this form
Thank you very much , When it comes to select a fund   you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results   can you believe that ?
I will think about it , Everyone wants to be financial lose kill  You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich  I ’ m thinking about buying stocks  It can be a good investment if I can manage well  What do you say ?
I just watched the investment TV program last weekend  It has become a very hot topic these days  Actually I am not even a beginner , I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products   but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense  Please quote us C  I  F  Rangoon
All right  Here are our F  O  B  price lists  All the prices are subject to our final confirmation , Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount  You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers
The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others  If you can manage to boost it a bit   we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount , As far as a trial order is concerned   the quantity is by no means small  And generally speaking   we like to profit from a trial order  I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements
I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession   and could not go any further , It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept  I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail
I ’ Ve looked at your units   and I am very happy with them  Your goods are all far above standard quality , We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better  We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits
Fine  Also   would you mind if I asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis , I really like what you have  But the price for this product is much higher than we expected  I am absolutely not a buyer at that price
Well   the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery  That is our best offer , Err   well   I can ’ t decide right now  Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon
No  These terms need to be amplified , What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ?
Yes   that's very important , I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles
I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that  You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months  The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there  I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources
There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses  That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones  To be frank with you   if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us   we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price , Well   we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price  But I ’ ll have to try   I suppose
But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers  Actually   some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales   you know , That's true  But I am sorry I can't make an exception  We have quoted you our lowest price  We can't give you any more discounts
Good  Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents , As a rule   we don't allow any commission  However   as an encouragement for businesses   we will allow you a 3 % commission
Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? , Certainly !
Quite good  The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste  How are you gonna pack these blouses ? , We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it  Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show  You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse
In April or early May , I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us  Our customs formalities are quite complicated   and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country  The fertilizers must be delivered before April   or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing
All right  You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment  The fertilizers will be delivered before April , We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet
A higher discount will be given for a big order   so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time , The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them  No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business
All right  Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value   up to the port of destination only , I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount
I am afraid I have some bad news for you  It's about our order contract O5TSWAL , What's the problem ?
But then there were some cracks in a number of cases  Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose , That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading   due to rough handling
But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough  When they were rehandled   some of them were broken , I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care
I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles  I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada  But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product , To be reliable is the strong point of our products  As a matter of fact   it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices  Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price
I am afraid not  We usually design the label ourselves  You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods , In that case   we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling
That can be easily done  Is there anything else ? , The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed   but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel
Welcome to China   Mr  White , How do you do   Ms  Chi ?
Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct  Exhibition there  Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind , Yes   we have  I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year  Here is a copy of it
Here are our catalog and price list  The catalog lists all the commodities we export   and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles , Thank you   Ms Chi  What are your normal export terms ?
That can be discussed , All right  When can we meet again for more specific details   Ms Chi ?
What arrangement will you make about payment ? , We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg  Is it at sight or after sight ?
I am afraid that can't be done  We have never done business on such terms , But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade  Other suppliers are offering better terms  Some even allow payment 60days after sight
Yes  We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers , If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly   and if you provide after-sales service   we agree to make the payment in full
That's right  Let's go into the details , Ok  I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep  We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales
Well  I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment  Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment , I hope you'll try to get them to step up production
I am sorry , What's your last word as to the date then ?
Good  Let's call it a deal  We will do our best to advance the shipment   but your L / C should be opened early Sep , I promise
Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? , How's this then ? We propose partial shipment  We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready
I agree with your proposal , I've come about your wools  According to our market survey   wools are likely to find a ready market in our country
It's FOB Shanghai , Could you quote the price of CIF Hamburg ?
Well   we've settled the problems of price   quality and quantity  What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? , Irrevocable letter of credit   of course  It's the normal terms of payment in international business
Anyhow   there would be certain bank charges  We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit  It would help me greatly   if you could accept D / A or D / P  It makes no difference to you   but it does to me , Well  As you understand   the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee  We always ask for L / C for our exports   and the other way around   we pay by L / C for our imports  We only accept L / C for regular orders
How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? , Four  They are Loco invoice   FOB invoice   CIF invoice and Franco invoice
Oh   I see , Hey   daughter  Let me ask you something
Well   no  It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay , You have children now  What if something   god forbid   happens to you ?
How are your stocks doing   Jim ? , Oh   all right  I lost a bunch of money in the last two years   but this year has been pretty good
I changed my strategy around too  I invest in good companies now , Yeah   me too  Did you hear about Ted ?
Oh   boy  His wife can't be happy about that , The City Bank  May I help you   sir ?
Adam Smith , Alright   what's your address ?
Next Friday , Okay  Where would you like to have your last bill sent to you ?
Our Afghan customers wanna buy China's tea  I am thinking of placing an order with you , Which tea do you prefer   black or jasmine tea ?
Oh   such a variety  All of them are excellent both in color and flavour  No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind  Could you give me some idea of the prices ? , Here is our price list  All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation  You can see the prices are reasonable
Yes  I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti   200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea   first grade , Good  We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon  Is that all right ?
Yes   I ’ Ve come to inquire about a 6 000- dollar remittance from California  Has it arrived ? , May I have your name   please ?
Really ? It should have arrived  It was sent a week ago , If the money was sent by cable   it would have taken about one or two days  But if it was sent by airmail   it would take at least one week
That would be very kind of you , Could you please tell me your phone number   so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ?
Hello ! How can I help you   sir ? , I want to take out a loan for school  What kind of interest rate do you offer ?
Well  In that case we can offer you a private educational loan , What's the interest rate ?
Just fill out this application  We can let you know right away if you qualify , All right   thank you !
Just a moment   please  Your name ? , Emily Smith
Here you go   Miss , Thank you
I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history  I just came to this country , Do you have an account with this bank ?
What is the interest rate on your card ? , The annual charge rate is 95 %
How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? , You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized
Hello   may I help you ? , Yes   I need some more cash for my visit in China  May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ?
Well   any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate   for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge  You see   hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest , You mean there is really not that much of a difference
Yes   I'll be happy to cash these for you  Would you please countersign them here ? , Ok
You ’ d better   to protect your clothes  Now please watch your step , Thank you  Is the production line fully automated ?
All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process , What ’ s the monthly output ?
About 2 % in normal operations , That ’ s wonderful  Is that where the finished products come off ?
It covers an area of 75 000 square meters , It ’ s much larger than I expected  When was the plant set up ?
Thank you , How many employees do you have in this plant ?
Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries  Well   here we ’ re at the production shop  Shall we start with the assembly line ? , That ’ s fine
Very impressive   indeed   especially the speed of your NW Model , That ’ s our latest development  A product with high performance  We put it on the market just two months ago
Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible , Right  Here is our sales catalog and literature
Pleased to see you   too   Mr  Brown , You've had a good trip   I hope
So it is   I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years , We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you  You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement
Thank you , But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative  After all   you sold around 400 pieces there last year  You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end
No   no  That's too big a number to be acceptable  Let's put it at 450 pieces  And we'll strive to sell more   of course  We wish to add another clause  For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota   we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts , All right   let's fix it at 450 pieces then  And for every additional 50 pianos sold   we'll give you 1 % higher commission
No   certainly not  That's a reasonable restriction , Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products
Good , I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks
Do you sell direct to shops ? , Yes   we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts  We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct   without any middlemen
That is   your commission , Yes   our commission is very reasonable  We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal
According to your estimate   what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill   in round figures   of course ? , We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business   as our remuneration increases with the turnover   but we will not guar - ante anything   at least not to begin with
Mr  Bergeron   you leave us no alternative  We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover  Besides our price is worked out according to the costing  A 10 % commission means an increase in our price  We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect , Oh   that's just too bad  I intended to make great efforts in selling your products
Oh   yes  We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction , All right   but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair  And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency
If that's the case   there's not much point in further discussion  We might as well call the whole deal off , What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price  The gap is too great
Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept  When I suggested we meet each other half way   I meant it literally , Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible
That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered  Let's meet each other half way once more   then the gap will be closed and our business completed , You certainly have a way of talking me into it  All right   let's meet half way again
What is it ? , My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U  S  import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently
Basically speaking   yes   we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D  C  Of course   there are more details to be attended to  We cannot settle it in a few words , Yes   of course  I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it  When do we meet again ?
First of all   I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country  I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us , We've been looking forward to your visit  It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest  It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face
I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers  This tends to complicate my business  As you know   I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line  I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come  One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years  As it is to our mutual interests and profit   I am sure you'll have no objection to it , We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers  As you know   the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial  However   according to our records   the total amount of your order last year was moderate   which does not warrant an agency appointment  Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent
Well   I admit I always do business on the safe side  Could you let me have your proposal then ? , Let's put it this way  I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60 000 pairs to be sold in the first year   70 000 pairs in the second year   and 80 000 pairs in the third year   the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island )   commission 5 %
Well   if you put it this way   I'll have to comply  When shall we sign the contract   Mrs  Brown ? , Tomorrow afternoon
We have a few different wholesale vendors   so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year  But the difference is miniscule   a fluctuation of about 02 % , That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit   doesn't it ? After all   your sticker price is pretty much set in stone  How much do they go for retail ?
No   that's the price before tax  The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas   so it is difficult for us to figure in , How much is your profit margin then ?
Good   if you ’ ll excuse me   I ’ ll go over the sheet right now , Take your time
We only ask that your prices be comparable to others  That ’ s reasonable   isn ’ t it ? , Well   to get the business done   we can consider making some concessions in our price  But first   you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us   so that we may adjust our prices accordingly
When I say your prices are much too high   I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent , How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers  It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet  May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? , Very well   I will
Just to comply   we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent  I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling , So do we  Certainly it's a step forward on your side  But the gap is still too wide
That won't do  You see   our profit margin is very narrow  It simply can't stand such a big cut , I hate to disappoint you   Mr  Brown   but if that's the case   we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere  Do think it over   please  We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion
Good  Friday morning at 9 , May I help you ?
I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars  Do you accept $ 100 bills ? , No problem   we can accept any denomination  How much would you like to exchange today ?
I guess   here   give me 5 000 RIB worth  I might as well exchange a little extra  Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! , So how did I do ?
It was closeTo be honest   you had the lowest price by three cents per hint   but they didn't like your delivery dateAcme promised them almost a full month sooner , So the price was good ?
NoIt was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time  Better luck next time , I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me
I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days , I'm afraid I can't wait that long  Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ?
Please give me a few minute to calculate  Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100  Is that price acceptable to you ? , Your estimated is seems a little high to me   we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit
We did the best that we could to give you a low price  Did you get our recent estimate ? , Based on the estimate you gave us   by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses   our profit is shortWith the offer you've given me   we're making next to nothingCan ' t you do any better ?
I'll tell you what   I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do  I can't give you any guarantees  But we can try , You got our email with all the specifications for the project  We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday  If you have any questions between now and then   please let me know
Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? , We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint  That's all I can say
So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? , Great ! And   how are things in your neck of the woods ?
Or a curse , Nope   it's a giftAnyway   we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time
Heck no   we doubled the price   but because it's you   I'll let you have'em at 50 off , You silver-tongued devil  Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
Than you   I'm not late   am I ? , No   no   no   not at allIt ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you
Please   I wish you would , Well   as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't   as a rule   deal with new people
That's pretty much what I heard , Well   those are my terms  As long as you honor them   we do businessIf you break faith and try to take advantage   I'll find someone else to work with  Can you live with that ?
Hello   Miss Wu   This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited  I'd like to check my last order  When exactly was it sent out ? , I can check that for you right now  Would you mind holding ?
Sure  Do you have my number ? , Yes   I have it right here  I'm so sorry about this
Hi   I need to transfer some money to another account  It ’ s urgent , Okay   have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
A company account  I need to pay a bill , Okay   I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number
Oh   that ’ s such a relief  I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue  Thank you so much , It ’ s my pleasure
Well   as you know   I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States  They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market  Naturally   your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately  I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant   luxurious   first class dining , Mmmm   sounds interesting  gourmet chocolates   where are they produced ? Belgium ?
That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units  They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well  Here   I brought these especially for you   try one ! , Oh   thanks  Mmm   hmm   creamy texture   very smooth
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations  I ’ m sure you can keep a secret  Buttermilk   cacao beans   sugar and Haggis , Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ?
Mr  Johnson ? Mr  Johnson ? , We've got a problem  it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth  The client thinks it's too dark   and they want to add halogen lighting  We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys   do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ?
It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out   and they are union labor  It'll cost you a pretty penny , How much do you think it would cost ?
It is   I'll tell you why  We'll have to call in the electrician   he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM   and it will probably take him an hour a light  Plus   the halogen lights take more electricity   so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well , Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting   I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens
Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 %   but if your company provides the insurance   that will save us a few bucks , Now   all this is available to you   as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period  That shouldn't be a problem   right ?
Great ! , I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both  I've thought through a lot of these details   and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon
Huh  I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do  How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 %   but you can have 90 days credits , Well   that might be acceptable   if you handle the insurance fees
But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what  I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit , Done
Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband   and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance   my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you , That ’ s true  If something happened to my husband   I might lose everything  Both of us have to work to keep our home   car   and our children ’ s education  I can ’ t afford that by myself
That was a beautiful car  It ’ s a new car   but it ’ s totaled , Well   your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it  So you don ’ t need to worry
What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? , If you got a smaller car   the cost should be a little less depending on the model   age   and size  Would you still want full coverage ?
China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation , We found your samples very attractiveWe ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable
It depends on how much you order , Can I use the FAS terms ?
Yes   it's the correct thing to do , But we may not get another partner
Well   these things happens   I know that  You just have to stay straight with me , Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ?
Yeah   it really is that simpleEvery time there's a change in the items we do business on   you let me know  That's all you need to do , What kind of change   just in prices ?
No   everthingThose things for sure   but also labor problems   raw materials   new subcontractors   mergers   in short   anything and everythingSo I can make a fully informed decision , So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry  I can do that   provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt
We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents , I see  Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ?
Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum , Still   there will be bank charges in connection with the credit  It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P  You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit  It makes no great difference to you   but it does to me
I'm very sorry   Mrs  Wang  But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that  As I've said   we require payment by L / C , Hi   Bill  It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd  How are you ?
Sure   what can I do for you ? , We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this yearYou know   so we can have the funds put aside
Well   I can give you those figures now over the phone   is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? , It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writingMake all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them  How soon can I have it ?
Well   just because it's you  Tomorrow   say around noon , Mrs  Miller   you are an old friend of ours  In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship   we are prepared to cut our price by 5 %  Will that satisfy you ?
Good  Now that the price is decided on   we can discuss the packaging , As to packaging   we'll pack them two dozens to one carton   gross weight about 25 kilos a carton
Could you use wooden cases instead ? , Why use wooden cases ?
All right  Carton or no carton   the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling , You needn't worry about that  Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients  Now   as regards payment   we have agreed to use dollars   am I right ?
No problem  That can be done  I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? , Right  We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule  Last   but not least   the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau   which is final and binding on both parties
Exactly  That's what we have done in the past , Well   it seems we have covered everything  We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days
That's fine too , Well   Mr  Brown   we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen  Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ?
Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen  They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen  Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service , Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ?
To get around your difficulty   Mr  Brown   I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half  You can send in an Addi trional order later , Well   I'll consider the possibility  By the way   when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ?
Getting the goods ready   making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time   you know  You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month , Very well   MrsWang  I'll not reduce my order  I'll take the full quantity you offer  And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home
You can rest assured of that  We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now   so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C , That'll be fine  I appreciate your cooperation
Well   this is something new  A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods  We think there are a lot of details to go into , If you feel our proposal is attractive   it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner
We'll talk about it next time  Now that everything is settled   let's have a cup of tea   and take our minds off business for a change , Hi   Mr  Brown   we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions
Ok   I'll show you how the packing is like  We have a showroom on the ground floor  Let's go downstairs and have a look , Sure
The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market  It catches the eyes and can help push sales , Good   what about the export packing ?
You can rest assured of that  So far   no customers have complained about our outer packing , I'm glad to hear that  By the way   do you accept neutral packing ?
All right  We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand , That price of ours   by the way   is for a minimum quantity of 1 000 saddles
Yes   of course  Assembly would be quite a simple matter  Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time , Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months
Yes  What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? , Perhaps  General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra
I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem , I should say it is something we have never come across before
Ah   there's something in what you're saying  According to the present FDA regulations   the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States , Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad   and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers  Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ?
Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C  I  F  basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations , Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling   as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products
Good  A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales  With competition from similar garments producers   the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive , Right you are  We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse
Cartons ? , Yes   corrugated cardboard boxes
I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load , The cartons are comparatively light   and therefore easy to handle  They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo  The stevedores will see to that  Besides   we'll reinforce the cartons with straps  Silk blouses are not fragile goods  They can stand a lot of jolting
Well   I don't want to take any chances  Besides   cartons are easy to cut open   and this increases the risk of pilferage , Tampering with cartons is easily detected  I should say that this rather discourages pilferage
If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing   we would be quite willing to accept cartons , I'm sorry   but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers  We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy   but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap
Well   I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter , Please do  I'll be waiting for your reply
Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? , By the middle of October   I think
Besides   the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks  Thus   after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers  The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season , But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter  In fact   many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter
That's too bad   but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration , You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you  But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands
Well   that was an interesting documentary ! , For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US
Yeah   I know it sounds weird   but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement  Through a 401K   you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan  Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire   you can rest peacefully on your nest egg , That ’ s interesting and logical I guess  In my country   we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund   but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that
I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! , It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods
I'm afraid we can't agree to that  We concluded the business with you here in Houston   and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York  We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle  Hong Kong is out of the question , It's like this  There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka   while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent  If shipment were effected from Hong Kong   we could receive the goods much earlier
Your idea may be a good one   but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong  How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment  It makes no difference to us  There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York , It sounds all right to me   but I will have to think about it  I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow  If I choose Seattle   will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ?
Yes  I would like some information for requesting a loan , Very well   here are the general terms of our loan policies  We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans
It sounds good but   there is just one problem  I have a terrible credit score , That is a very serious problem you see   the bank must assess your personal information   past loans   assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan
Of course  Please sit down  How can I help you ? , I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content
Let me just check that on my computer  Oakfield is a low risk area   so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month  The other thing to take into account is deductibles , In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000  what does that mean exactly ?
If you have higher deductibles   your premium are lower   because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less , It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding  I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree
That is of great concern to out clients  We aim to satisfy all claims within a month   but we can ’ t guarantee that , I want to open a saving account   sir  What's the proper procedure ?
No   Even a dollar is all right  Here's your passbook   sir   just sign your name on it , What is the annual interest rate ?
By all means  But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks , Next   please  May I help you   sir ?
What features do they offer ? , Well   if you just take a look here   see   with our chequing account   you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee   and our savings account has a higher interest rate   but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10 000 dollars
No   that won ’ t be necessary , In that case   I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork  I ’ ll need your social insurance number   and two pieces of government ID  If you could just sign here   and here   and here we ’ ll be all set  Would you like to make a deposit today ?
Yes  I'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily , Well   in that case   I think a checking account may be more convenient for you  However   there's a service charge
Sounds reasonable  Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ? , More than enough  Please fill in this form
May I help you ? , I'd like to withdraw some money

I use several services  Of course   I deposit and withdraw money quite often  I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account  I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another  I often travel abroad   you see , Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around
Yes   I do  It save me a lot of time  I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines , That ’ s good idea  You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that  I suppose you have a mortgage too
I don ’ t have one  I prefer to buy shares  My bank also provides a share trading service  It ’ s cheap and easy to use , That ’ s great  But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain
Well   you can pay by mail   telegraphic or SWIFT transfer  Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary , Which is the best way ?
Why don't you send it by mail payment order ? , How long does it take ?
Sure  You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer , And how long do those take ?
You have to fill out this form   ma'am , How do you use an ATM card   billy ?
You really shouldn ’ t write it down  You should memorize it  You can change it to a more convenient number if you like , Ok   I've entered my PIN  There are several options on the screen  I guess I just choose which service I want   don't I ?
That's right  Give the machine a moment to process you request  Then take your money , These machines aren't very difficult to use  In fact   I quite like them  They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk

That's very convenient , It is  Our customers really like it  Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ?
Is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? , Yes   but it's not much  You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account  It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards
Thank you very much , You're welcome

I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floorsThat ' s what you think   yes ? , Yes  You could use five or six unitsBut five or six wouldn't be very efficient  I recommend seven
Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? , As I said   it is possible   but it would be much more expensive  I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system
So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars , Yes   that's for the unitsInstallation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollarsBut it depends on the time spent   of course
In Taipei   you know   the company usually installs the things they sellThey don't charge extra , I know that   Ma'am  But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costsHere in L  A    installation is charged separately
And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars , It's a question of quality   Ma'am  At that price   you would not get good equipment  I've been in this business for almost twenty years  I know what happensIf you don't get quality air conditioning now   you will just have to replace the system after two years
You do seem like a better company than the other oneSo I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you  But I won't pay more than 6000 , Well   we don't usually do it   but  I believe we can accommodate you on thisWe will do the installation for free  Because we appreciate your business
